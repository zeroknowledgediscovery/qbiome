 abstract = {Sequence analysis of the neuraminidase (NA) genes of
influenza virus X-7(F1) and of 12 variants selected with
monoclonal antibodies has been used to define in physical
terms the antigenic structure of this NA, which was
operationally established by R. G. Webster, L. E. Brown,
and W. G. Laver (1984, Virology 135, 30–42). X-7(F1) is a
reassortant virus containing the NA of the early Asian
(H2N2) isolate A/RI/5+/57, and the results of antigenic and
sequence analysis of X-7(F1) and of variants selected with
monoclonal antibodies have been combined with a similar
analysis of the A/Tokyo/3/67 NA (H2N2, M. R. Lentz, G. M.
Air, W. G. Laver, and R. G. Webster (1984), Virology 135,
257–265) to obtain a model of antibody binding to N2 NAs.
The selection process was biased, however, since only those
monoclonal antibodies which inhibited NA activity could be
used to select variants. Most of the changes in the
variants selected with monoclonal antibodies occur in those
parts of the polypeptide chain which encircle the enzyme
active site pocket in the three-dimensional structure (P.
M. Colman, J. N. Varghese, and W. G. Laver (1983), Nature
(London) 303, 41–44). The results suggest that in general
the antibody binds to a site on the NA which includes those
amino acid side chains which are altered in monoclonal
variants. There are, however, several aspects of the
antigen-antibody interaction which are not easily
explained, and which will probably only be fully elucidated
by X-ray crystallographic analysis of NA-antibody
complexes.},

@article{barman2012,
 abstract = {North American triple reassortant swine (TRS) influenza A
viruses have caused sporadic human infections since 2005,
but human-to-human transmission has not been documented.
These viruses have six gene segments (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP,
and NS) closely related to those of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic
viruses. Therefore, understanding of these viruses'
pathogenicity and transmissibility may help to identify
determinants of virulence of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic viruses
and to elucidate potential human health threats posed by
the TRS viruses. Here we evaluated in a ferret model the
pathogenicity and transmissibility of three groups of North
American TRS viruses containing swine-like and/or
human-like HA and NA gene segments. The study was designed
only to detect informative and significant patterns in the
transmissibility and pathogenicity of these three groups of
viruses. We observed that irrespective of their HA and NA
lineages, the TRS viruses were moderately pathogenic in
ferrets and grew efficiently in both the upper and lower
respiratory tracts. All North American TRS viruses studied
were transmitted between ferrets via direct contact.
However, their transmissibility by respiratory droplets was
related to their HA and NA lineages: TRS viruses with
human-like HA and NA were transmitted most efficiently,
those with swine-like HA and NA were transmitted minimally
or not transmitted, and those with swine-like HA and
human-like NA (N2) showed intermediate transmissibility. We
conclude that the lineages of HA and NA may play a crucial
role in the respiratory droplet transmissibility of these
viruses. These findings have important implications for
pandemic planning and warrant confirmation.},

 abstract = {The H1N1 Eurasian avian-like swine (EAsw) influenza
viruses originated from an avian H1N1 virus. To
characterize potential changes in the membrane fusion
activity of the hemagglutinin (HA) during avian-to-swine
adaptation of the virus, we studied EAsw viruses isolated
in the first years of their circulation in pigs and closely
related contemporary H1N1 viruses of wild aquatic birds.
Compared to the avian viruses, the swine viruses were less
sensitive to neutralization by lysosomotropic agent NH 4 Cl
in MDCK cells, had a higher pH optimum of hemolytic
activity, and were less stable at acidic pH. Eight amino
acid substitutions in the HA were found to separate the
EAsw viruses from their putative avian precursor; four
substitutions—T49 2 S, N72 2 D, R75 2 K, and S113 2
F—were located in the structural regions of the HA2
subunit known to play a role in acid-induced conformational
transition of the HA. We also studied low-pH-induced
syncytium formation by cell-expressed HA proteins and found
that the HAs of the 1918, 1957, 1968, and 2009 pandemic
viruses required a lower pH for fusion induction than did
the HA of a represen-tative EAsw virus. Our data show that
transmission of an avian H1N1 virus to pigs was accompanied
by changes in conforma-tional stability and fusion
promotion activity of the HA. We conclude that distinctive
host-determined fusion characteristics of the HA may
represent a barrier for avian-to-swine and swine-to-human
transmission of influenza viruses. IMPORTANCE},

@article{bl07,
 abstract = {Complex nonlinear dynamics arise in many fields of science
and engineering, but uncovering the underlying differential
equations directly from observations poses a challenging
task. The ability to symbolically model complex networked
systems is key to understanding them, an open problem in
many disciplines. Here we introduce for the first time a
method that can automatically generate symbolic equations
for a nonlinear coupled dynamical system directly from time
series data. This method is applicable to any system that
can be described using sets of ordinary nonlinear
differential equations, and assumes that the (possibly
noisy) time series of all variables are observable.
Previous automated symbolic modeling approaches of coupled
physical systems produced linear models or required a
nonlinear model to be provided manually. The advance
presented here is made possible by allowing the method to
model each (possibly coupled) variable separately,
intelligently perturbing and destabilizing the system to
extract its less observable characteristics, and
automatically simplifying the equations during modeling. We
demonstrate this method on four simulated and two real
systems spanning mechanics, ecology, and systems biology.
Unlike numerical models, symbolic models have explanatory
value, suggesting that automated “reverse engineering”
approaches for model-free symbolic nonlinear system
identification may play an increasing role in our ability
to understand progressively more complex systems in the
future.},

@article{brierley,
 abstract = {Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), particularly
zoonoses, represent a significant threat to global health.
Emergence is often driven by anthropogenic activity (e.g.,
travel, land use change). Although disease emergence
frameworks suggest multiple steps from initial zoonotic
transmission to human-to-human spread, there have been few
attempts to empirically model specific steps. We create a
process-based framework to separate out components of
individual emergence steps. We focus on early emergence and
expand the first step, zoonotic transmission, into
processes of generation of pathogen richness, transmission
opportunity, and establishment, each with its own
hypothesized drivers. Using this structure, we build a
spatial empirical model of these drivers, taking bat
viruses shared with humans as a case study. We show that
drivers of both viral richness (host diversity and climatic
variability) and transmission opportunity (human population
density, bushmeat hunting, and livestock production) are
associated with virus sharing between humans and bats. We
also show spatial heterogeneity between the global patterns
of these two processes, suggesting that high-priority
locations for pathogen discovery and surveillance in
wildlife may not necessarily coincide with those for public
health intervention. Finally, we offer direction for future
studies of zoonotic EIDs by highlighting the importance of
the processes underlying their emergence.},

 abstract = {We have constructed an operational antigenic map of the
hemagglutinin of influenza virus A/PR/8/34, which indicates
the presence of five immunodominant antigenic regions
exhibiting various degrees of operational linkage. These
sites have been located by the identification of changed
amino acid residues in mutant viruses that are
antigenically altered at each site. Comparison of the
antigenic features with the three-dimensional structure of
the H3 subtype hemagglutinin shows that the antigenic sites
correspond to four topographically distinct regions of the
surface of the protein. One of the sites is formed when two
regions that are widely separated in the hemagglutinin
monomer associate in the assembled trimer. The location of
the sites relative to those proposed for the H3 subtype
hemagglutinin suggests that carbohydrate modulates the
antigenicity of specific regions of the hemagglutinin.

stars, underlying almost all automated discovery tasks is
the ability to compare and contrast data streams with each

the prevalence of data, however, automated methods are not
keeping pace. A key bottleneck is that most data comparison
algorithms today rely on a human expert to specify what
{\textquoteleft}features{\textquoteright} of the data are
relevant for comparison. Here, we propose a new principle
for estimating the similarity between the sources of
arbitrary data streams, using neither domain knowledge nor
learning. We demonstrate the application of this principle
to the analysis of data from a number of real-world
challenging problems, including the disambiguation of
electro-encephalograph patterns pertaining to epileptic
seizures, detection of anomalous cardiac activity from
heart sound recordings and classification of astronomical
objects from raw photometry. In all these cases and without
access to any domain knowledge, we demonstrate performance
on a par with the accuracy achieved by specialized
algorithms and heuristics devised by domain experts. We
suggest that data smashing principles may open the door to
understanding increasingly complex observations, especially
when experts do not know what to look for.},

 abstract = {Identifying meaningful signal buried in noise is a problem
of interest arising in diverse scenarios of data-driven
modeling. We present here a theoretical framework for
exploiting intrinsic geometry in data that resists noise
corruption, and might be identifiable under severe
obfuscation. Our approach is based on uncovering a valid
complete inner product on the space of ergodic stationary
finite valued processes, providing the latter with the
structure of a Hilbert space on the real field. This
rigorous construction, based on non-standard
generalizations of the notions of sum and scalar
multiplication of finite dimensional probability vectors,
allows us to meaningfully talk about "angles" between data
streams and data sources, and, make precise the notion of
orthogonal stochastic processes. In particular, the
relative angles appear to be preserved, and identifiable,
under severe noise, and will be developed in future as the
underlying principle for robust classification, clustering
and unsupervised featurization algorithms.},

@article{crutchfield199411,
 abstract = {Defining structure and detecting the emergence of
complexity in nature are inherently subjective, though
essential, scientific activities. Despite the difficulties,
these problems can be analyzed in terms of how
model-building observers infer from measurements the
computational capabilities embedded in nonlinear processes.
An observer's notion of what is ordered, what is random,
and what is complex in its environment depends directly on
its computational resources: the amount of raw measurement
data, of memory, and of time available for estimation and
inference. The discovery of structure in an environment
depends more critically and subtlely though on how those
resources are organized. The descriptive power of the
observer's chosen (or implicit) computational model class,
for example, can be an overwhelming determinant in finding
regularity in data. This paper presents an overview of an
inductive framework-hierarchical ϵ-machine
reconstruction—in which the emergence of complexity is
associated with the innovation of new computational model
classes. Complexity metrics for detecting structure and
quantifying emergence, along with an analysis of the
constraints on the dynamics of innovation, are outlined.
Illustrative examples are drawn from the onset of
unpredictability in nonlinear systems, finitary
nondeterministic processes, and cellular automata pattern
recognition. They demonstrate how finite inference
resources drive the innovation of new structures and so
lead to the emergence of complexity.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we consider probabilistic context-free
grammars, a class of generative devices that has been
successfully exploited in several applications of syntactic
pattern matching, especially in statistical natural
language parsing. We investigate the problem of training
probabilistic context-free grammars on the basis of
distributions defined over an infinite set of trees or an
infinite set of sentences by minimizing the cross-entropy.
This problem has applications in cases of context-free
approximation of distributions generated by more expressive
statistical models. We show several interesting theoretical
properties of probabilistic context-free grammars that are
estimated in this way, including the previously unknown
equivalence between the grammar cross-entropy with the
input distribution and the so-called derivational entropy
of the grammar itself. We discuss important consequences of
these results involving the standard application of the
maximum-likelihood estimator on finite tree and sentence
samples, as well as other finite-state models such as
hidden Markov models and probabilistic finite automata.},

 abstract = {Hemagglutinin (HA), a trimeric spike glycoprotein of
influenza virus, mediates fusion between the viral envelope
and the membrane of an endosome during virus entry. Fusion
is triggered by low pH, which induces an irreversible
conformational change in the protein. Several studies have
indicated that intersubunit contacts along the trimer
interfaces may be broken during this alteration. To
determine whether HA dissociates into individual subunits
as a consequence of the conformational change, we used
velocity gradient sedimentation in the presence of Triton
X-100. We also determined the resistance of acid-treated HA
to dissociation by sodium dodecyl sulfate, a property of
the HA trimer. At pH 7.0, isolated HA sedimented as a 9S
trimer and gave the characteristic trimer pattern after
sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
After acidification the HA remained trimeric irrespective
of whether it was exposed to acid in intact virus particles
or in solubilized form. Only when very low concentrations
of HA were acidified did a fraction dissociate to dimers
and monomers. In contrast, the water-soluble ectodomain
fragment of HA (BHA) readily dissociated under a variety of
conditions. Negative-stain electron microscopy supported
the notion that HA molecules in virus particles do not
dissociate upon acidification and may form larger
oligomeric structures in the plane of the viral membrane.
Taken together, the results suggested that it is the
trimeric HA, or higher-order structures thereof, that are
active in the acid-induced fusion reaction. Further, the
results emphasized the role of the transmembrane anchors of
HA in preventing dissociation of the trimer.},

 abstract = {Zoonotic disease surveillance is typically triggered after
animal pathogens have already infected humans. Are there
ways to identify high-risk viruses before they emerge in
humans? If so, then how and where can identifications be
made and by what methods? These were the fundamental
questions driving a workshop to examine the future of
predictive surveillance for viruses that might jump from
animals to infect humans. Virologists, ecologists and
computational biologists from academia, federal government
and non-governmental organizations discussed opportunities
as well as obstacles to the prediction of species jumps
using genetic and ecological data from viruses and their
hosts, vectors and reservoirs. This workshop marked an
important first step towards envisioning both scientific
and organizational frameworks for this future capability.
Canine parvoviruses as well as seasonal H3N2 and pandemic
H1N1 influenza viruses are discussed as exemplars that
suggest what to look for in anticipating species jumps. To
answer the question of where to look, prospects for
discovering emerging viruses among wildlife, bats, rodents,
arthropod vectors and occupationally exposed humans are
discussed. Finally, opportunities and obstacles are
identified and accompanied by suggestions for how to look
for species jumps. Taken together, these findings
constitute the beginnings of a conceptual framework for
achieving a virus surveillance capability that could
predict future species jumps.},

 abstract = {Rapid antigenic evolution in the influenza A virus
hemagglutinin precludes effective vaccination with existing
vaccines. To understand this phenomenon, we passaged virus
in mice immunized with influenza vaccine. Neutralizing
antibodies selected mutants with single–amino acid
hemagglutinin substitutions that increased virus binding to
cell surface glycan receptors. Passaging these high-avidity
binding mutants in na{\"{i}}ve mice, but not immune mice,
selected for additional hemagglutinin substitutions that
decreased cellular receptor binding avidity. Analyzing a
panel of monoclonal antibody hemagglutinin escape mutants
revealed a positive correlation between receptor binding
avidity and escape from polyclonal antibodies. We propose
that in response to variation in neutralizing antibody
pressure between individuals, influenza A virus evolves by
adjusting receptor binding avidity via amino acid
substitutions throughout the hemagglutinin globular domain,
many of which simultaneously alter antigenicity.},

 abstract = {The scientific understanding of the driving factors behind
zoonotic and pandemic influenzas is hampered by complex
interactions between viruses, animal hosts and humans. This
complexity makes identifying influenza viruses of high
zoonotic or pandemic risk, before they emerge from animal
populations, extremely difficult and uncertain. As a first
step towards assessing zoonotic risk of influenza, we
demonstrate a risk assessment framework to assess the
relative likelihood of influenza A viruses, circulating in
animal populations, making the species jump into humans.
The intention is that such a risk assessment framework
could assist decision-makers to compare multiple influenza
viruses for zoonotic potential and hence to develop
appropriate strain-specific control measures. It also
provides a first step towards showing proof of principle
for an eventual pandemic risk model. We show that the
spatial and temporal epidemiology is as important in
assessing the risk of an influenza A species jump as
understanding the innate molecular capability of the virus.
We also demonstrate data deficiencies that need to be
addressed in order to consistently combine both
epidemiological and molecular virology data into a risk
assessment framework.},

 abstract = {Recursive binary partitioning is a popular tool for
regression analysis. Two fundamental problems of exhaustive
search procedures usually applied to fit such models have
been known for a long time: overfitting and a selection
bias towards covariates with many possible splits or
missing values. While pruning procedures are able to solve
the overfitting problem, the variable selection bias still
seriously affects the interpretability of tree-structured
regression models. For some special cases unbiased
procedures have been suggested, however lacking a common
theoretical foundation. We propose a unified framework for
recursive partitioning which embeds tree-structured
regression models into a well defined theory of conditional
inference procedures. Stopping criteria based on multiple
test procedures are implemented and it is shown that the
predictive performance of the resulting trees is as good as
the performance of established exhaustive search
procedures. It turns out that the partitions and therefore

 abstract = {The glycoprotein HA (haemagglutinin) on the surface of
influenza A virus plays a central role in recognition and
binding to specific host cell-surface glycan receptors and
in fusion of viral membrane to the host nuclear membrane
during viral replication. Given the abundance of HA on the
viral surface, this protein is also the primary target for
host innate and adaptive immune responses. Although
addition of glycosylation sites on HA are a part of viral
evolution to evade the host immune responses, there are
specific glycosylation sites that are conserved during most
of the evolution of the virus. In the present study, it was
demonstrated that one such conserved glycosylation site at
Asn(91) in H1N1 HA critically governs the glycan
receptor-binding specificity and hence would potentially
impinge on the host adaptation of the virus.},

@article{kang2017,
 abstract = {In recent years, various studies have been conducted on
the prediction of crime occurrences. This predictive
capability is intended to assist in crime prevention by
facilitating effective implementation of police patrols.
Previous studies have used data from multiple domains such
as demographics, economics, and education. Their prediction
models treat data from different domains equally. These
methods have problems in crime occurrence prediction, such
as difficulty in discovering highly nonlinear
relationships, redundancies, and dependencies between
multiple datasets. In order to enhance crime prediction
models, we consider environmental context information, such
as broken windows theory and crime prevention through
environmental design. In this paper, we propose a
feature-level data fusion method with environmental context
based on a deep neural network (DNN). Our dataset consists
of data collected from various online databases of crime
statistics, demographic and meteorological data, and images
in Chicago, Illinois. Prior to generating training data, we
select crime-related data by conducting statistical
analyses. Finally, we train our DNN, which consists of the
following four kinds of layers: spatial, temporal,
environmental context, and joint feature representation
layers. Coupled with crucial data extracted from various
domains, our fusion DNN is a product of an efficient
decision-making process that statistically analyzes data
redundancy. Experimental performance results show that our
DNN model is more accurate in predicting crime occurrence
than other prediction models. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

 abstract = {``We won't comment here on the long history of the book,
which is recounted in [E. L. Lehmann, Statist. Sci. 12
(1997), no. 1, 48--52; MR1466430], but shall use this
Preface to indicate the principal changes from the second
edition [E. L. Lehmann, Testing statistical hypotheses,
Second edition, Wiley, New York, 1986; MR0852406
(87j:62001)]. ``The present volume is divided into two
parts. Part I (Chapters 1--10) treats small-sample theory,
while Part II (Chapters 11--15) treats large-sample theory.
The preface to the second edition stated that `the most
important omission is an adequate treatment of optimality
paralleling that given for estimation in the companion
volume [E. L. Lehmann and G. Casella, Theory of point
estimation, Second edition, Springer, New York, 1998;
MR1639875 (99g:62025)]'. We here remedy this failure by
treating the difficult topic of asymptotic optimality (in
Chapter 13) together with the large-sample tools needed for
this purpose (in Chapters 11 and 12). Having developed
these tools, we use them in Chapter 14 to give a much
fuller treatment of tests of goodness of fit than was
possible in the second edition, and in Chapter 15 to
provide an introduction to the bootstrap and related
techniques. Various large-sample considerations that in the
second edition were discussed in earlier chapters now have
been moved to Chapter 11.

``Another major addition is a more comprehensive treatment
of multiple testing including some recent optimality
results. This topic is now presented in Chapter 9. In order
to make room for these extensive additions, we had to
eliminate some material found in the second edition,
primarily the coverage of the multivariate linear
hypothesis.

``Except for some of the basic results from Part I, a
detailed knowledge of small-sample theory is not required
for Part II. In particular, the necessary background should
include: Chapter 3, Sections 3.1--3.5, 3.8--3.9; Chapter 4:
Sections 4.1--4.4; Chapter 5, Sections 5.1--5.3; Chapter 6,
Sections 6.1--6.2; Chapter 7, Sections 7.1--7.2; Chapter 8,

@article{li2013,
 abstract = {The hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay is the primary
measurement used for identifying antigenically novel
influenza virus strains. HAI assays measure the amount of
reference sera required to prevent virus binding to red
blood cells. Receptor binding avidities of viral strains
are not usually taken into account when interpreting these
assays. Here, we created antigenic maps of human H3N2
viruses that computationally account for variation in viral
receptor binding avidities. These new antigenic maps differ
qualitatively from conventional antigenic maps based on HAI
measurements alone. We experimentally focused on an
antigenic cluster associated with a single N145K
hemagglutinin (HA) substitution that occurred between 1992
and 1995. Reverse-genetics experiments demonstrated that
the N145K HA mutation increases viral receptor binding
avidity. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA)
revealed that the N145K HA mutation does not prevent
antibody binding; rather, viruses possessing this mutation
escape antisera in HAI assays simply by attaching to cells
more efficiently. Unexpectedly, we found an asymmetric
antigenic effect of the N145K HA mutation. Once H3N2
viruses acquired K145, an epitope involving amino acid 145
became antigenically dominant. Antisera raised against an
H3N2 strain possessing K145 had reduced reactivity to H3N2
strains possessing N145. Thus, individual mutations in HA
can influence antigenic groupings of strains by altering
receptor binding avidity and by changing the dominance of
antibody responses. Our results indicate that it will be
important to account for variation in viral receptor
binding avidity when performing antigenic analyses in order
to identify genuine antigenic differences among influenza
virus variants.},

@article{li2020.07.17.20156364,
 abstract = {As we begin to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, a key
question is if we can avert such disasters in future.
Current surveillance protocols generally focus on
qualitative impact assessments of viral diversity 1. These
efforts are primarliy aimed at ecosystem and human impact
monitoring, and do not help to precisely quantify
emergence. Currently, the similarity of biological strains
is measured by the edit distance or the number of mutations
that separate their genomic sequences 2{\textendash}6, e.g.
the number of mutations that make an avian flu strain
human-adapted. However, ignoring the odds of those
mutations in the wild keeps us blind to the true jump risk,
and gives us little indication of which strains are more
risky. In this study, we develop a more meaningful metric
for comparison of genomic sequences. Our metric, the
q-distance, precisely quantifies the probability of
spontaneous jump by random chance. Learning from patterns
of mutations from large sequence databases, the q-distance
adapts to the specific organism, the background population,
and realistic selection pressures; demonstrably improving
inference of ancestral relationships and future
trajectories. As important application, we show that the
q-distance predicts future strains for seasonal Influenza,
outperforming World Health Organization (WHO) recommended
flu-shot composition almost consistently over two decades.
Such performance is demonstrated separately for Northern
and Southern hemisphere for different subtypes, and key
capsidic proteins. Additionally, we investigate the
SARS-CoV-2 origin problem, and precisely quantify the
likelihood of different animal species that hosted an
immediate progenitor, producing a list of related species
of bats that have a quantifiably high likelihood of being
the source. Additionally, we identify specific rodents with
a credible likelihood of hosting a SARS-CoV-2 ancestor.
Combining machine learning and large deviation theory, the
analysis reported here may open the door to actionable
predictions of future pandemics.Competing Interest

 abstract = {Learning a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) from a
training set of labeled strings is a hard task that has
been much studied within the machine learning community. It
is equivalent to learning a regular language by example and
has applications in language modeling. In this paper, we
describe a novel evolutionary method for learning DFA that
evolves only the transition matrix and uses a simple
deterministic procedure to optimally assign state labels.
We compare its performance with the evidence driven state
merging (EDSM) algorithm, one of the most powerful known
DFA learning algorithms. We present results on random DFA
induction problems of varying target size and training set
density. We also study the effects of noisy training data
on the evolutionary approach and on EDSM. On noise-free
data, we find that our evolutionary method outperforms EDSM
on small sparse data sets. In the case of noisy training
data, we find that our evolutionary method consistently
outperforms EDSM, as well as other significant methods
submitted to two recent competitions.},

@article{mair2014,
 abstract = {Influenza A virus strains adopt different host
specificities mainly depending on their hemagglutinin (HA)
protein. Via HA, the virus binds sialic acid receptors of
the host cell and, upon endocytic uptake, HA triggers
fusion between the viral envelope bilayer and the endosomal
membrane by a low pH-induced conformational change leading
to the release of the viral genome into the host cell
cytoplasm. Both functions are crucial for viral infection
enabling the genesis of new progeny virus. Adaptation to
different hosts in vitro was shown to require mutations
within HA altering the receptor binding and/or fusion
behavior of the respective virus strain. Human adapted
influenza virus strains (H1N1, H3N2, H2N2) as well as
recent avian influenza virus strains (H5, H7 and H9
subtypes) which gained the ability to infect humans mostly
contained mutations in the receptor binding site (RBS) of
HA enabling increased binding affinity of these viruses to
human type ($\alpha$-2,6 linked sialic acid) receptors.
Thus, the receptor binding specificity seems to be the
major requirement for successful adaptation to the human
host; however, the RBS is not the only determinant of host
specificity. Increased binding to a certain cell type does
not always correlate with infection efficiency.
Furthermore, viruses carrying mutations in the RBS often
resulted in reduced viral fitness and were still unable to
transmit between mammals. Recently, the pH stability of HA
was reported to affect the transmissibility of influenza
viruses. This review summarizes recent findings on the
adaptation of influenza A viruses to the human host and
related amino acid substitutions resulting in altered
receptor binding specificity and/or modulated fusion pH of
HA. Furthermore, the role of these properties (receptor
specificity and pH stability of HA) for adaptation to and
transmissibility in the human host is discussed. This
article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Viral Membrane
Protiens -- Channels for Cellular Networking.},

 abstract = {The problem of the inference of finite-state probabilistic
grammars is studied from two points of view. First, the
theoretical aspects of grammatical inference are
considered. Among the topics investigated are the
structural and statistical properties of probabilistic
grammars, methods for assigning probability measures to
rewrite rules of probabilistic grammars, and statistical
measures for determining how well an inferred probabilistic
grammar approximates a sample set. The second concern of
the study is the development and implementation of an
algorithm for the inference of finite-state probabilistic
grammars. This finite-state inference procedure produces a
deterministic finite-state probabilistic grammar whose
language approximates the sample set within a user-supplied
acceptance region under the chi-square test. This procedure
is enumerative. Heuristic tree-searching techniques are
used to improve efficiency. The convergence of the
procedure to an acceptable grammar is demonstrated and the
steps of the procedure are theoretically justified. Test
results of a PL/I implementation are presented. The
inference procedure developed provides a means of
synthesizing a probabilistic model of both physical and
abstract systems from samples of their behavior.},

 abstract = {Influenza viruses routinely acquire mutations in antigenic
sites on the globular head of the hemagglutinin (HA)
protein. Since these antigenic sites are near the receptor
binding pocket of HA, many antigenic mutations
simultaneously alter the receptor binding properties of HA.
We previously reported that a K165E mutation in the Sa
antigenic site of A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) HA is associated
with secondary neuraminidase (NA) mutations that decrease
NA activity. Here, using reverse genetics, we show that the
K165E HA mutation dramatically decreases HA binding to
sialic acid receptors on cell surfaces. We sequentially
passaged reverse-genetics-derived PR8 viruses with the
K165E antigenic HA mutation in fertilized chicken eggs, and
to our surprise, viruses with secondary NA mutations did
not emerge. Instead, viruses with secondary HA mutations
emerged in 3 independent passaging experiments, and each of
these mutations increased HA binding to sialic acid
receptors. Importantly, these compensatory HA mutations
were located in the Ca antigenic site and prevented binding
of Ca-specific monoclonal antibodies. Taken together, these
data indicate that HA antigenic mutations that alter
receptor binding avidity can be compensated for by
secondary HA or NA mutations. Antigenic diversification of
influenza viruses can therefore occur irrespective of
direct antibody pressure, since compensatory HA mutations
can be located in distinct antibody binding sites.},

 abstract = {The majority of human emerging infectious diseases are
zoonotic, with viruses that originate in wild mammals of
particular concern (for example, HIV, Ebola and SARS).
Understanding patterns of viral diversity in wildlife and
determinants of successful cross-species transmission, or
spillover, are therefore key goals for pandemic
surveillance programs. However, few analytical tools exist
to identify which host species are likely to harbour the
next human virus, or which viruses can cross species
boundaries. Here we conduct a comprehensive analysis of
mammalian host–virus relationships and show that both the
total number of viruses that infect a given species and the
proportion likely to be zoonotic are predictable. After
controlling for research effort, the proportion of zoonotic
viruses per species is predicted by phylogenetic
relatedness to humans, host taxonomy and human population
within a species range—which may reflect human–wildlife
contact. We demonstrate that bats harbour a significantly
higher proportion of zoonotic viruses than all other
mammalian orders. We also identify the taxa and geographic
regions with the largest estimated number of 'missing
viruses' and 'missing zoonoses' and therefore of highest
value for future surveillance. We then show that
phylogenetic host breadth and other viral traits are
significant predictors of zoonotic potential, providing a
novel framework to assess if a newly discovered mammalian
virus could infect people.},

@article{pearce2000,
 abstract = {When I first started studying epidemiology, ecological
studies were briefly discussed as an inexpensive but
unreliable method for studying individual level risk
factors for disease. For example, rather than go to the
time and expense to establish a cohort study or
case-control study of fat intake and breast cancer, you
could simply use national dietary and cancer incidence data
and, with minimal time and expense, show a strong
correlation internationally between fat intake and breast
cancer. This approach was quite rightly regarded as
inadequate and unreliable because of the many additional
forms of bias that can occur in such studies compared with
studies of individuals within a population. In particular,
the “ecological fallacy” can occur in that factors that
are associated with national disease rates may not be
associated with disease in individuals.1 For example,
almost any disease that is associated with affluence and
Westernisation has in the past been associated at the
national level with sales of television sets, and nowadays
is probably associated at the national level with rates of
internet use.

Thus, ecological studies were not a good thing to do, and
were a relic of the “pre-modern” phase of epidemiology
before it became firmly established with a methodologic
paradigm based on the theory of randomised controlled
trials of individuals. This paradigm, which is very
powerful when used appropriately, gave rise to increasingly
sophisticated methods of study design and data analysis. In
particular, biostatistical methods that were developed for
randomised trials involving a single individual level
exposure were used to reformulate and make more rigorous
the previously ad hoc epidemiological methods of study
design and data analysis.2 3 Thus, epidemiology courses
have increasingly become restricted to discussing cohort
and case-control studies and the methods of data analysis
that fit the clinical trial paradigm on which {\ldots}},

high intelligence, receptive language, verbal and motor

seizures, mental retardation and genetic syndromes are
unfavorable signs, whereas head growth does not predict
outcome. Controlled studies that report the most recovery
came about after the use of behavioral techniques. Residual
vulnerabilities affect higher-order communication and
attention. Tics, depression and phobias are frequent
residual co-morbidities after recovery. Possible mechanisms
of recovery include: normalizing input by forcing attention
outward or enriching the environment; promoting the
reinforcement value of social stimuli; preventing
interfering behaviors; mass practice of weak skills;
reducing stress and stabilizing arousal. Improving

 abstract = {Increased autism prevalence rates have generated
considerable concern. However, the contribution of changes
in diagnostic practices to increased prevalence rates has
not been thoroughly examined. Debates over the role of
diagnostic substitution also continue. California has been
an important test case in these controversies. The
objective of this study was to determine the extent to
which the increased prevalence of autism in California has
been driven by changes in diagnostic practices, diagnostic
substitution and diagnostic accretion.\\ Retrospective case
record examination of 7003 patients born before 1987 with
autism who were enrolled with the California Department of
Developmental Services between 1992 and 2005 was carried
out. Of principal interest were 631 patients with a sole
diagnosis of mental retardation (MR) who subsequently
acquired a diagnosis of autism. The outcome of interest was
the probability of acquiring a diagnosis of autism as a
result of changes in diagnostic practices was calculated.
The probability of diagnostic change is then used to model
the proportion of the autism caseload arising from changing
diagnostic practices.\\ The odds of a patient acquiring an
autism diagnosis were elevated in periods in which the
practices for diagnosing autism changed. The odds of change
in years in which diagnostic practices changed were 1.68
[95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.11-2.54], 1.55 (95\% CI
1.03-2.34), 1.58 (95\% CI 1.05-2.39), 1.82 (95\% CI
1.23-2.7) and 1.61 (95\% CI 1.09-2.39). Using the
probability of change between 1992 and 2005 to generalize
to the population with autism, it is estimated that 26.4\%
(95\% CI 16.25-36.48) of the increased autism caseload in
California is uniquely associated with diagnostic change
through a single pathway--individuals previously diagnosed
with MR.\\ Changes in practices for diagnosing autism have
had a substantial effect on autism caseloads, accounting
for one-quarter of the observed increase in prevalence in
California between 1992 and 2005.},

 abstract = {Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of
neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by social and
language deficits, stereotypic behavior, and abnormalities
in motor functions. The particular set of behavioral
impairments expressed in any given individual is variable
across the spectrum. These behavioral abnormalities are
consistent with our current understanding of the
neuropathology of ASD which suggests abnormalities in the
amygdala, temporal and frontal cortexes, hippocampus, and
cerebellum. However, regions unrelated to these behavioral
deficits appear largely intact. Both genetic predisposition
and environmental toxins and toxicants have been implicated
in the etiology of autism; the impact of these
environmental triggers is associated with increases in
oxidative stress, and is further exacerbated when combined
with genetic susceptibility. We have previously reported
increased levels of 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), a marker of
oxidative stress, in ASD cerebella. We have also shown that
this increase was associated with an elevation in
neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) levels. The objectives of the current
study were to determine whether the increase in oxidative
stress in ASD is brain region-specific, to identify the
specific brain regions affected by oxidative stress, and to
compare brain region-specific NT-3 expression between ASD
and control cases. The levels of 3-NT and NT-3 were
measured with specific ELISAs in individual brain regions
of two autistic and age- and postmortem interval
(PMI)--matched control donors. In the control brain, the
levels of 3-NT were uniformly low in all brain regions
examined ranging from 1.6 to 12.0 pmol/g. On the other
hand, there was a great variation in 3-NT levels between
individual brain regions of the autistic brains ranging
from 1.7 to 281.2 pmol/g. The particular brain regions with
the increased 3-NT and the magnitude of the increase were
both different in the two autistic cases. In the older
autistic case, the brain regions with highest levels of
3-NT included the orbitofrontal cortex (214.5 pmol/g),
Wernicke's area (171.7 pmol/g), cerebellar vermis (81.2
pmol/g), cerebellar hemisphere (37.2 pmol/g), and pons
(13.6 pmol/g); these brain areas are associated with the
speech processing, sensory and motor coordination,
emotional and social behavior, and memory. Brain regions
that showed 3-NT increase in both autistic cases included
the cerebellar hemispheres and putamen. Consistent with our
earlier report, we found an increase in NT-3 levels in the
cerebellar hemisphere in both autistic cases. We also
detected an increase in NT-3 level in the dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex (BA46) in the older autistic case and in
the Wernicke's area and cingulate gyrus in the younger
case. These preliminary results reveal, for the first time,
brain region-specific changes in oxidative stress marker
3-NT and neurotrophin-3 levels in ASD.},

process that modulate host physiology, many of which are
associated with immunity and nutrient intake. Here, we
report that colonization by gut microbiota impacts
mammalian brain development and subsequent adult behavior.
Using measures of motor activity and anxiety-like behavior,
we demonstrate that germ free (GF) mice display increased
motor activity and reduced anxiety, compared with specific
pathogen free (SPF) mice with a normal gut microbiota. This
behavioral phenotype is associated with altered expression
of genes known to be involved in second messenger pathways
and synaptic long-term potentiation in brain regions
implicated in motor control and anxiety-like behavior. GF
mice exposed to gut microbiota early in life display
similar characteristics as SPF mice, including reduced
expression of PSD-95 and synaptophysin in the striatum.
Hence, our results suggest that the microbial colonization
process initiates signaling mechanisms that affect neuronal
circuits involved in motor control and anxiety behavior.},

a pathogenic role in a subgroup of patients with autism.
This study aimed to investigate the frequency of serum
anti-ganglioside M1 auto-antibodies, as indicators of the
presence of autoimmunity to CNS, in a group of autistic
children. We are the first to measure the relationship
between these antibodies and the degree of the severity of
autism.\\ Serum anti-ganglioside M1 antibodies were
measured, by ELISA, in 54 autistic children, aged between 4
and 12 years, in comparison to 54 healthy-matched children.
Autistic severity was assessed by using the Childhood
Autism Rating Scale (CARS).\\ Autistic children had
significantly higher serum levels of anti-ganglioside M1
antibodies than healthy children (P < 0.001). The
seropositivity of anti-ganglioside M1 antibodies was found
in 74\% (40/54) of autistic children. Serum levels of
anti-ganglioside M1 antibodies were significantly higher in
autistic children with severe autism (63\%) than those with
mild to moderate autism (37\%), P = 0.001. Moreover, serum
anti-ganglioside M1 antibodies had significant positive
correlations with CARS (P < 0.001).\\ Serum levels of
anti-ganglioside M1 antibodies were increased in many
autistic children. Also, their levels had significant
positive correlations with the degree of the severity of
autism. Thus, autism may be, in part, one of the pediatric
autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders. Further wide-scale
studies are warranted to shed light on the possible
etiopathogenic role of anti-ganglioside M1 auto-antibodies
in autism. The role of immunotherapy in autistic patients
who have increased serum levels of anti-ganglioside M1

years in Arizona with Autistic Spectrum Disorder (n = 55)
compared with non-sibling, neurotypical controls (n = 44)

Neither group had taken any vitamin/mineral supplements in

Checklist (ATEC), and Severity of Autism Scale (SAS). Study
measurements included: vitamins, biomarkers of vitamin
status, minerals, plasma amino acids, plasma glutathione,
and biomarkers of oxidative stress, methylation, sulfation
and energy production.\\ Biomarkers of children with autism
compared to those of controls using a t-test or Wilcoxon
test found the following statistically significant
differences (p < 0.001): Low levels of biotin, plasma
glutathione, RBC SAM, plasma uridine, plasma ATP, RBC NADH,
RBC NADPH, plasma sulfate (free and total), and plasma
tryptophan; also high levels of oxidative stress markers
and plasma glutamate. Levels of biomarkers for the
neurotypical controls were in good agreement with accessed
published reference ranges. In the Autism group, mean
levels of vitamins, minerals, and most amino acids commonly
measured in clinical care were within published reference
ranges.A stepwise, multiple linear regression analysis
demonstrated significant associations between several
groups of biomarkers with all three autism severity scales,
including vitamins (adjusted R2 of 0.25-0.57), minerals
(adj. R2 of 0.22-0.38), and plasma amino acids (adj. R2 of
0.22-0.39).\\ The autism group had many statistically
significant differences in their nutritional and metabolic
status, including biomarkers indicative of vitamin
insufficiency, increased oxidative stress, reduced capacity
for energy transport, sulfation and detoxification. Several
of the biomarker groups were significantly associated with
variations in the severity of autism. These nutritional and
metabolic differences are generally in agreement with other
published results and are likely amenable to nutritional
supplementation. Research investigating treatment and its

among the most heritable of neuropsychiatric disorders,
much of autism research has focused on the search for
genetic variants in protein-coding genes (i.e., the

genome-wide association studies have often identified
statistically significant associations of genetic
variations in regions of DNA that do not code for proteins

that such noncoding regions are actively transcribed and
may participate in the regulation of genes, including genes
on different chromosomes. This article summarizes evidence
that suggests that the research spotlight needs to be
expanded to encompass far-reaching gene-regulatory
mechanisms that include a variety of epigenetic
modifications, as well as noncoding RNA (i.e., the

ASD subgroups can be distinguished from nonautistic
controls on the basis of limited sets of differentially
expressed genes with a predicted classification accuracy of
up to 94\% and sensitivities and specificities of ~90\% or
better, based on support vector machine analyses with
leave-one-out validation. Validation of a subset of the
"classifier" genes by high-throughput quantitative nuclease
protection assays with a new set of LCL samples derived
from individuals in one of the phenotypic subgroups and
from a new set of controls resulted in an overall class
prediction accuracy of ~82\%, with ~90\% sensitivity and
75\% specificity. Although additional validation with a
larger cohort is needed, and effective clinical translation
must include confirmation of the differentially expressed
genes in primary cells from cases earlier in development,
we suggest that such panels of genes, based on expression
analyses of phenotypically more homogeneous subgroups of
individuals with ASD, may be useful biomarkers for
diagnosis of subtypes of idiopathic autism.},

10.0 (95\% CI, 9.6-10.3) using DSM-5 criteria compared with
the reported prevalence based on DSM-IV-TR criteria of 11.3

which may be related to the inappropriate microbial

microbes to colonize the preterm infant gut encounter a

potentially has the greatest opportunity to fundamentally
influence intestinal development and immune function. The

Gnotobiotic mouse models with experimental colonization by

demonstrate that certain early preterm infant microbiota

the ASD cortex. IL-8, tPA, and IBA-1 were downregulated in
SCZ cortex; IL-1b was increased in the SCZ cerebellum.
Differences between SCZ and ASD were observed for most of
the genes analyzed in both brain areas. CLDN-5 protein was
increased in ASD cortex and cerebellum, while CLDN-12
appeared reduced in both ASD and SCZ cortexes. In the
intestine, 75\% of the ASD samples analyzed had reduced
expression of barrier-forming TJ components (CLDN-1, OCLN,
TRIC), whereas 66\% had increased pore-forming CLDNs
(CLDN-2, -10, -15) compared to controls.\\ In the ASD
brain, there is an altered expression of genes associated
with BBB integrity coupled with increased neuroinflammation
and possibly impaired gut barrier integrity. While these
findings seem to be specific for ASD, the possibility of
more distinct SCZ subgroups should be explored with
additional studies.},

signature that could be used to classify subjects with
autism spectrum disorder (ASD) compared to controls on the
basis of blood gene expression profiles. The gene
expression profiles could ultimately be used as diagnostic
biomarkers for ASD.\\ We used the published microarray data
(GSE26415) from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, which
included 21 young adults with ASD and 21 age- and
sex-matched unaffected controls. Nineteen differentially
expressed probes were identified from a training dataset
(n=26, 13 ASD cases and 13 controls) using the limma
package in R language (adjusted p value ï¼œ0.05) and
were further analyzed in a test dataset (n=16, 8 ASD cases
and 8 controls) using machine learning algorithms.\\
Hierarchical cluster analysis showed that subjects with ASD
were relatively well-discriminated from controls. Based on
the support vector machine and K-nearest neighbors
analysis, validation of 19-DE probes with a test dataset
resulted in an overall class prediction accuracy of 93.8\%
as well as a sensitivity and specificity of 100\% and
87.5\%, respectively.\\ The results of our exploratory
study suggest that the gene expression profiles identified
from the peripheral blood samples of young adults with ASD
can be used to identify a biological signature for ASD.
Further study using a larger cohort and more homogeneous
datasets is required to improve the diagnostic accuracy.},

DNA methylation and RNA sequencing to examine gene

Differentially methylated regions were enriched for immune
signaling pathways and important microglial developmental
transcription factor binding motifs. Differential

controlling microglial sensitivity to the environment and
shaping neuronal connections in the developing brain.

 abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD).\\ 2014.\\ The Autism and
Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network is an
active surveillance system that provides estimates of the
prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) among children
aged 8 years whose parents or guardians reside within 11
ADDM sites in the United States (Arizona, Arkansas,
Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, New
Jersey, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Wisconsin). ADDM
surveillance is conducted in two phases. The first phase
involves review and abstraction of comprehensive
evaluations that were completed by professional service
providers in the community. Staff completing record review
and abstraction receive extensive training and supervision
and are evaluated according to strict reliability standards
to certify effective initial training, identify ongoing
training needs, and ensure adherence to the prescribed
methodology. Record review and abstraction occurs in a
variety of data sources ranging from general pediatric
health clinics to specialized programs serving children
with developmental disabilities. In addition, most of the
ADDM sites also review records for children who have
received special education services in public schools. In
the second phase of the study, all abstracted information
is reviewed systematically by experienced clinicians to
determine ASD case status. A child is considered to meet
the surveillance case definition for ASD if he or she
displays behaviors, as described on one or more
comprehensive evaluations completed by community-based
professional providers, consistent with the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition,
Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) diagnostic criteria for autistic
disorder; pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise
specified (PDD-NOS, including atypical autism); or Asperger
disorder. This report provides updated ASD prevalence
estimates for children aged 8 years during the 2014
surveillance year, on the basis of DSM-IV-TR criteria, and
describes characteristics of the population of children
with ASD. In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association
published the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), which made considerable
changes to ASD diagnostic criteria. The change in ASD
diagnostic criteria might influence ADDM ASD prevalence
estimates; therefore, most (85\%) of the records used to
determine prevalence estimates based on DSM-IV-TR criteria
underwent additional review under a newly operationalized
surveillance case definition for ASD consistent with the
DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. Children meeting this new
surveillance case definition could qualify on the basis of
one or both of the following criteria, as documented in
abstracted comprehensive evaluations: 1) behaviors
consistent with the DSM-5 diagnostic features; and/or 2) an
ASD diagnosis, whether based on DSM-IV-TR or DSM-5
diagnostic criteria. Stratified comparisons of the number
of children meeting either of these two case definitions
also are reported.\\ For 2014, the overall prevalence of
ASD among the 11 ADDM sites was 16.8 per 1,000 (one in 59)
children aged 8 years. Overall ASD prevalence estimates
varied among sites, from 13.1-29.3 per 1,000 children aged
8 years. ASD prevalence estimates also varied by sex and
race/ethnicity. Males were four times more likely than
females to be identified with ASD. Prevalence estimates
were higher for non-Hispanic white (henceforth, white)
children compared with non-Hispanic black (henceforth,
black) children, and both groups were more likely to be
identified with ASD compared with Hispanic children. Among
the nine sites with sufficient data on intellectual
ability, 31\% of children with ASD were classified in the
range of intellectual disability (intelligence quotient
[IQ] <70), 25\% were in the borderline range (IQ 71-85),
and 44\% had IQ scores in the average to above average
range (i.e., IQ >85). The distribution of intellectual
ability varied by sex and race/ethnicity. Although mention
of developmental concerns by age 36 months was documented
for 85\% of children with ASD, only 42\% had a
comprehensive evaluation on record by age 36 months. The
median age of earliest known ASD diagnosis was 52 months
and did not differ significantly by sex or race/ethnicity.
For the targeted comparison of DSM-IV-TR and DSM-5 results,
the number and characteristics of children meeting the
newly operationalized DSM-5 case definition for ASD were
similar to those meeting the DSM-IV-TR case definition,
with DSM-IV-TR case counts exceeding DSM-5 counts by less
than 5\% and approximately 86\% overlap between the two
case definitions (kappa = 0.85).\\ Findings from the ADDM
Network, on the basis of 2014 data reported from 11 sites,
provide updated population-based estimates of the
prevalence of ASD among children aged 8 years in multiple
communities in the United States. The overall ASD
prevalence estimate of 16.8 per 1,000 children aged 8 years
in 2014 is higher than previously reported estimates from
the ADDM Network. Because the ADDM sites do not provide a
representative sample of the entire United States, the
combined prevalence estimates presented in this report
cannot be generalized to all children aged 8 years in the
United States. Consistent with reports from previous ADDM
surveillance years, findings from 2014 were marked by
variation in ASD prevalence when stratified by geographic
area, sex, and level of intellectual ability. Differences
in prevalence estimates between black and white children
have diminished in most sites, but remained notable for
Hispanic children. For 2014, results from application of
the DSM-IV-TR and DSM-5 case definitions were similar,
overall and when stratified by sex, race/ethnicity,
DSM-IV-TR diagnostic subtype, or level of intellectual
ability.\\ Beginning with surveillance year 2016, the DSM-5
case definition will serve as the basis for ADDM estimates
of ASD prevalence in future surveillance reports. Although
the DSM-IV-TR case definition will eventually be phased
out, it will be applied in a limited geographic area to
offer additional data for comparison. Future analyses will
examine trends in the continued use of DSM-IV-TR diagnoses,
such as autistic disorder, PDD-NOS, and Asperger disorder
in health and education records, documentation of symptoms
consistent with DSM-5 terminology, and how these trends
might influence estimates of ASD prevalence over time. The
latest findings from the ADDM Network provide evidence that
the prevalence of ASD is higher than previously reported
estimates and continues to vary among certain racial/ethnic
groups and communities. With prevalence of ASD ranging from
13.1 to 29.3 per 1,000 children aged 8 years in different
communities throughout the United States, the need for
behavioral, educational, residential, and occupational
services remains high, as does the need for increased
research on both genetic and nongenetic risk factors for ASD.},

data from the Study to Explore Early Development (SEED), a
multi-site case-control study of children born 2003-2006 in

disorders (DD). We investigated maternal immune conditions
during the pregnancy period, as well as lifetime history of
these conditions in several family members (mother, father,
siblings, and study child). Logistic regression analyses
included 663 children with ASD, 984 children with DD, and
915 controls ascertained from the general population (POP).
Maternal history of eczema/psoriasis and asthma was
associated with a 20\%-40\% increased odds of both ASD and
DD. Risk estimates varied by specific ASD subphenotypes in
association with these exposures. In addition, children
with ASD were more likely to have a history of
psoriasis/eczema or allergies than POP controls. No
association was observed for paternal history or family

that common genetic variants link the abnormalities in the

hypothesis is based on the recently identified common
genetic variants: early B cell factor 1 (EBF1),
selenocysteine tRNA-specific eukaryotic elongation factor

the maternal and infant DNA samples, associated with risk
of preterm birth and independently implicated in a risk of
autism. We predict that the AGTR2 variants involved in the

 abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental
condition that affects one in 59 children in the United
States. Although there is a mounting body of knowledge of
cortical and cerebellar contributions to ASD, our knowledge
about the early developing brainstem in ASD is only
beginning to accumulate. Understanding how brainstem
neurotransmission is implicated in ASD is important because
many of this condition's sensory and motor symptoms are
consistent with brainstem pathology. Therefore, the purpose
of this review was to integrate epidemiological,
behavioral, histological, neuroimaging, and animal evidence
of brainstem contributions to ASD. Because ASD is a
neurodevelopmental condition, we examined the available
data through a lens of hierarchical brain development. The
review of the literature suggests that developmental
alterations of the brainstem could have potential cascading
effects on cortical and cerebellar formation, ultimately
leading to ASD symptoms. This view is supported by human
epidemiology findings and data from animal models of ASD,
showing that perturbed development of the brainstem
substructures, particularly during the peak formation of
the brainstem's monoaminergic centers, may relate to ASD or
ASD-like behaviors. Furthermore, we review evidence from
human histology, psychophysiology, and neuroimaging
suggesting that brainstem development and maturation may be
atypical in ASD and may be related to key ASD symptoms,
such as atypical sensorimotor features and social
responsiveness. From this review there emerges the need of
future research to validate early detection of the
brainstem-based somatosensory and psychophysiological
behaviors that emerge in infancy, and to examine the
brainstem across the life span, while accounting for age.
In all, there is preliminary evidence for brainstem
involvement in ASD, but a better understanding of the
brainstem's role would likely pave the way for earlier

 abstract = {Bacterial colonization patterns in preterm infants differ
from those of their term counterparts due to maternal
microbial diversity, delivery mode, feeding methods,
antibiotic use, and exposure to commensal microbiota and
pathogens in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Early
gut microbiome dysbiosis predisposes neonates to
necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a devastating intestinal
disease with high morbidity and mortality. Though
mechanisms of NEC pathogenesis are not fully understood,
the microbiome is a promising therapy target for prevention
and treatment. Direct administration of probiotics to
preterm infants has been shown to reduce the incidence of
NEC, but is not without risk. The immature immune systems
of preterm infants leave them vulnerable to even beneficial
bacteria. Further research is required to investigate both
short-term and long-term effects of probiotic
administration to preterm infants. Other methods of
altering the preterm infant microbiome must also be
considered, including breastfeeding, prebiotics, and
targeting the maternal microbiome.},

 abstract = {Co-occurring medical disorders and associated
physiological abnormalities in individuals with autism
spectrum disorder (ASD) may provide insight into causal
pathways or underlying biological mechanisms. Here, we
review medical conditions that have been repeatedly
highlighted as sharing the strongest associations with
ASD-epilepsy, sleep, as well as gastrointestinal and immune
functioning. We describe within each condition their
prevalence, associations with behavior, and evidence for
successful treatment. We additionally discuss research
aiming to uncover potential aetiological mechanisms. We
then consider the potential interaction between each group
of conditions and ASD and, based on the available evidence,
propose a model that integrates these medical comorbidities
in relation to potential shared aetiological mechanisms.
Future research should aim to systematically examine the
interactions between these physiological systems, rather
than considering these in isolation, using robust and
sensitive biomarkers across an individual's development. A
consideration of the overlap between medical conditions and
ASD may aid in defining biological subtypes within ASD and
in the development of specific targeted interventions.},

@article{pmid30823414,
 abstract = {In recent years, there has been an emerging interest in
the possible role of the gut microbiota as a co-factor in
the development of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), as
many studies have highlighted the bidirectional
communication between the gut and brain (the so-called
"gut-brain axis"). Accumulating evidence has shown a link
between alterations in the composition of the gut
microbiota and both gastrointestinal and neurobehavioural
symptoms in children with ASD. The aim of this narrative
review was to analyse the current knowledge about dysbiosis
and gastrointestinal (GI) disorders in ASD and assess the
current evidence for the role of probiotics and other
non-pharmacological approaches in the treatment of children
with ASD. Analysis of the literature showed that gut
dysbiosis in ASD has been widely demonstrated; however,
there is no single distinctive profile of the composition
of the microbiota in people with ASD. Gut dysbiosis could
contribute to the low-grade systemic inflammatory state
reported in patients with GI comorbidities. The
administration of probiotics (mostly a mixture of
Bifidobacteria, Streptococci and Lactobacilli) is the most
promising treatment for neurobehavioural symptoms and bowel
dysfunction, but clinical trials are still limited and
heterogeneous. Well-designed, randomized,
placebo-controlled clinical trials are required to validate
the effectiveness of probiotics in the treatment of ASD and
to identify the appropriate strains, dose, and timing of
treatment.},

@article{pn2010,
 abstract = {Fractal dimension (FD) is a natural measure of the
irregularity of a curve. In this study the performances of
three waveform FD estimation algorithms (i.e. Katz's,
Higuchi's and the k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) algorithm)
were compared in terms of their ability to detect the onset
of epileptic seizures in scalp electroencephalogram (EEG).
The selection of parameters involved in FD estimation,
evaluation of the accuracy of the different algorithms and
assessment of their robustness in the presence of noise
were performed based on synthetic signals of known FD. When
applied to scalp EEG data, Katz's and Higuchi's algorithms
were found to be incapable of producing consistent changes
of a single type (either a drop or an increase) during
seizures. On the other hand, the k-NN algorithm produced a
drop, starting close to the seizure onset, in most seizures
of all patients. The k-NN algorithm outperformed both
Katz's and Higuchi's algorithms in terms of robustness in
the presence of noise and seizure onset detection ability.
The seizure detection methodology, based on the k-NN
algorithm, yielded in the training data set a sensitivity
of 100% with 10.10 s mean detection delay and a false
positive rate of 0.27 h(-1), while the corresponding values
in the testing data set were 100%, 8.82 s and 0.42 h(-1),
respectively. The above detection results compare
favourably to those of other seizure onset detection
methodologies applied to scalp EEG in the literature. The
methodology described, based on the k-NN algorithm, appears
to be promising for the detection of the onset of epileptic
seizures based on scalp EEG.},

@article{saito1994,
 abstract = {To locate antigenic epitopes on the N8 neuraminidase (NA),
we generated a panel of 97 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), 66
of which inhibited NA activity (NI antibodies). Three
groups of NI MAbs were identified from their different
reactivities with escape mutants. Group 1 antibodies
recognized the peptide loop containing residues 344 to 346,
which appears to be an immunodominant region on the rim of
the enzyme center of the N8 NA. Group 2 antibodies
recognized a novel epitope containing residues 150, 199,
367, 399, and 400 (N2 numbering). From the location of
these residues on the three-dimensional structure of the N8
NA, the epitope appears to be located at the interface of
two adjacent monomers in the tetrameric NA, one
contributing residues 150 and 199 and the other
contributing residues 367 and 399 to 400. The available
evidence indicates that the MAbs of this group react with
the NA only after it is fully assembled. The third group of
antibodies recognized the peptide loops containing residues
367 and 399 to 400. All of the amino acid substitutions in
N8 escape mutants which affect the NI activity of
antibodies were located in the peptide loops known to form
epitopes in the N2 and N9 subtypes, indicating that
antigenic regions in the NA head inducing NI antibodies
appear to be similar among different subtypes of influenza
A viruses. The MAbs used in this study will be valuable in
studying the role of each N8 NA epitope in host immune
defense systems and in the kinetics analysis of the
biosynthesis of the enzyme.},

 abstract = {We present the largest exome sequencing study of autism
spectrum disorder (ASD) to date (n=35,584 total samples,
11,986 with ASD). Using an enhanced Bayesian framework to
integrate de novo and case-control rare variation, we
identify 102 risk genes at a false discovery rate <= 0.1.
Of these genes, 49 show higher frequencies of disruptive de
novo variants in individuals ascertained for severe
neurodevelopmental delay, while 53 show higher frequencies
in individuals ascertained for ASD; comparing ASD cases
with mutations in these groups reveals phenotypic
differences. Expressed early in brain development, most of
the risk genes have roles in regulation of gene expression
or neuronal communication (i.e., mutations effect
neurodevelopmental and neurophysiological changes), and 13
fall within loci recurrently hit by copy number variants.
In human cortex single-cell gene expression data,
expression of risk genes is enriched in both excitatory and
inhibitory neuronal lineages, consistent with multiple
paths to an excitatory/inhibitory imbalance underlying
ASD.},

@misc{schwartz1994,
 abstract = {Ecological studies have been evaluated in epidemiological
contexts in terms of the "ecological fallacy." Although the
empirical evidence for a lack of comparability between
correlations derived from ecological- and individual-level
analyses is compelling, the conceptual meaning of the
ecological fallacy remains problematic. This paper argues
that issues in cross-level inference can be usefully
conceptualized as validity problems, problems not peculiar
to ecological-level analyses. Such an approach increases
the recognition of both potential inference problems in
individual-level studies and the unique contributions of
ecological variables. This, in turn, expands the terrain
for the location of causes for disease and interventions to
improve the public's health.},

cross-correlation functions (ACF's and CCF's) as tools for
clarifying relations that may occur within and between time
series at various lags. In addition, we have explained how
to build linear models based on classical regression theory
for exploiting the associations indicated by large values
of the ACF or CCF. The time domain methods of this chapter,
contrasted with the frequency domain methods introduced in
later chapters, are appropriate when we are dealing with
possibly nonstationary, shorter time series; these series
are the rule rather than the exception in applications
arising in economics and the social sciences. In addition,
the emphasis in these fields is usually on forecasting
future values, which is easily treated as a regression
problem. This chapter develops a number of regression
techniques for time series that are all related to
classical ordinary and weighted or correlated least
squares.},

@article{sl09,
 abstract = {{For centuries, scientists have attempted to identify and
document analytical laws that underlie physical phenomena
in nature. Despite the prevalence of computing power, the
process of finding natural laws and their corresponding
equations has resisted automation. A key challenge to
finding analytic relations automatically is defining
algorithmically what makes a correlation in observed data
important and insightful. We propose a principle for the
identification of nontriviality. We demonstrated this
approach by automatically searching motion-tracking data
captured from various physical systems, ranging from simple
harmonic oscillators to chaotic double-pendula. Without any
prior knowledge about physics, kinematics, or geometry, the
algorithm discovered Hamiltonians, Lagrangians, and other
laws of geometric and momentum conservation. The discovery
rate accelerated as laws found for simpler systems were
used to bootstrap explanations for more complex systems,
gradually uncovering the ” alphabet” used to describe
those systems.}},

@article{sl11,
 abstract = {{The reverse engineering of metabolic networks from
experimental data is traditionally a labor-intensive task
requiring a priori systems knowledge. Using a proven model
as a test system, we demonstrate an automated method to
simplify this process by modifying an existing or related
model---suggesting nonlinear terms and structural
modifications---or even constructing a new model that
agrees with the system's time series observations. In
certain cases, this method can identify the full dynamical
model from scratch without prior knowledge or structural
assumptions. The algorithm selects between multiple
candidate models by designing experiments to make their
predictions disagree. We performed computational
experiments to analyze a nonlinear seven-dimensional model
of yeast glycolytic oscillations. This approach corrected
mistakes reliably in both approximated and overspecified
models. The method performed well to high levels of noise
for most states, could identify the correct model de novo ,
and make better predictions than ordinary parametric
regression and neural network models. We identified an
invariant quantity in the model, which accurately derived
kinetics and the numerical sensitivity coefficients of the
system. Finally, we compared the system to dynamic flux
estimation and discussed the scaling and application of
this methodology to automated experiment design and control
in biological systems in real time.}},

virus provides evidence that the virus is a reassortment

typical of swine flu sequences prior to entering humans,

Initial transmission to humans appears to have occurred
several months before recognition of the outbreak. An
estimate of the gaps in genetic surveillance points to a
period of years between the reassortment of swine lineages
and the transfer to humans and the multiple genetic
ancestry is inconsistent with an artificial origin for the

highlight the need for the systematic surveillance of
influence in swine as a means of identifying potentially
pandemic strains before they cross into human

 abstract = {Relaxation labeling processes are a class of mechanisms
that solve the problem of assigning labels to objects in a
manner that is consistent with respect to some
domain-specific constraints. We reformulate this using the
model of a team of learning automata interacting with an
environment or a high-level critic that gives noisy
responses as to the consistency of a tentative labeling
selected by the automata. This results in an iterative
linear algorithm that is itself probabilistic. Using an
explicit definition of consistency we give a complete
analysis of this probabilistic relaxation process using
weak convergence results for stochastic algorithms. Our
model can accommodate a range of uncertainties in the
compatibility functions. We prove a local convergence
result and show that the point of convergence depends both
on the initial labeling and the constraints. The algorithm
is implementable in a highly parallel fashion.},

emerged in Mexico and the United States. The strain was
referred to as "swine flu" as it has strong similarities
with current circulating swine influenza viruses, although
the first outbreak on a swine farm was recorded more than 2
mo following the first human reports. This new strain,
designated as pandemic (H1N1) 2009, has shown the ability
to spread amongst the human population and can be found on
all continents. The way influenza viruses and specifically
this influenza A pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus evolve is
described in this manuscript.},

@article{wang2013,
 abstract = {In 2009, we successfully produced a high-yield live
attenuated H1N1pdm A/California/7/2009 vaccine (CA/09 LAIV)
by substitution of three residues (K119E, A186D, and D222G)
in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein. Since then, we have
generated and evaluated additional H1N1pdm vaccine
candidates from viruses isolated in 2010 and 2011. The 2010
strains with the new HA substitutions near the HA receptor
binding site (N125D and D127E or D127E and K209E) grew well
in eggs and formed large plaques in Madin-Darby canine
kidney (MDCK) cells. Introduction of these acidic amino
acids into the HA of CA/09 also improved vaccine virus
growth in eggs to a titer comparable to that of CA/09 LAIV.
However, the high growth of A/Gilroy/231/2011 (Gil/11)
vaccine virus required modification in both the HA and the
NA segments. The residue at position 369 of the NA was
found to be critical for virus replication in MDCK cells
and eggs. These HA and NA residues had minimal impact on
viral entry but greatly improved viral release from
infected cells. Our data implied that the HA receptor
binding and NA receptor cleaving function of the
poor-growth H1N1pdm virus was not well balanced for virus
replication in host cells. The high-growth vaccine
candidates described in this study maintained vaccine virus
antigenicity and induced high levels of neutralizing
antibodies in immunized ferrets, making them suitable for
vaccine production. The identification of the amino acids
and their roles in viral replication should greatly help
vaccine manufacturers to produce high-yield reassortant
vaccine viruses against the future drifted H1N1pdm
viruses.},

 abstract = {Influenza A H3N2 virus caused 1968 Hong Kong influenza
pandemic, and has since been one of the most prevalent
seasonal influenza viruses in global populations,
representing a credible pandemic candidate in future.
Previous studies have established that the hemagglutinin
(HA) protein is the predominant antigen and executes
receptor binding and membrane fusion. Homologous sequence
analysis of all HA subtypes of influenza viruses revealed
that two cysteine residues (540 and 544) are uniquely
present in the transmembrane domain (TM) of HA proteins
from all influenza A H3N2 viruses. However, the functions
of these two cysteines have not been fully studied. Here,
we generated three mutants (C540S, C544L, and 2C/SL) to
investigate the effects of the two TM cysteines on the
biological functions of H3 HA. We herein presented
evidences that the mutations of one or two of the cysteines
did not affect the proper expressions of HA proteins in
cells, and more importantly all mutant H3 HAs showed
decreased thermal stability but increased fusion activity
in comparison with wildtype HA. Our results taken together
demonstrated that the two TM cysteines are important for
the biological functions of H3 HA proteins.},

more efficiently in nasal turbinate epithelium and
subsequently transmit between ferrets. Receptor affinity
should be considered as a factor limiting swine virus
