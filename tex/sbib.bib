  abstract	= {Sequence analysis of the neuraminidase (NA) genes of
		  influenza virus X-7(F1) and of 12 variants selected with
		  monoclonal antibodies has been used to define in physical
		  terms the antigenic structure of this NA, which was
		  operationally established by R. G. Webster, L. E. Brown,
		  and W. G. Laver (1984, Virology 135, 30–42). X-7(F1) is a
		  reassortant virus containing the NA of the early Asian
		  (H2N2) isolate A/RI/5+/57, and the results of antigenic and
		  sequence analysis of X-7(F1) and of variants selected with
		  monoclonal antibodies have been combined with a similar
		  analysis of the A/Tokyo/3/67 NA (H2N2, M. R. Lentz, G. M.
		  Air, W. G. Laver, and R. G. Webster (1984), Virology 135,
		  257–265) to obtain a model of antibody binding to N2 NAs.
		  The selection process was biased, however, since only those
		  monoclonal antibodies which inhibited NA activity could be
		  used to select variants. Most of the changes in the
		  variants selected with monoclonal antibodies occur in those
		  parts of the polypeptide chain which encircle the enzyme
		  active site pocket in the three-dimensional structure (P.
		  M. Colman, J. N. Varghese, and W. G. Laver (1983), Nature
		  (London) 303, 41–44). The results suggest that in general
		  the antibody binds to a site on the NA which includes those
		  amino acid side chains which are altered in monoclonal
		  variants. There are, however, several aspects of the
		  antigen-antibody interaction which are not easily
		  explained, and which will probably only be fully elucidated
		  by X-ray crystallographic analysis of NA-antibody
		  complexes.},

		  These viruses have six gene segments (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP,
		  and NS) closely related to those of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic
		  viruses. Therefore, understanding of these viruses'
		  pathogenicity and transmissibility may help to identify
		  determinants of virulence of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic viruses
		  and to elucidate potential human health threats posed by
		  the TRS viruses. Here we evaluated in a ferret model the
		  pathogenicity and transmissibility of three groups of North
		  American TRS viruses containing swine-like and/or
		  human-like HA and NA gene segments. The study was designed
		  only to detect informative and significant patterns in the
		  transmissibility and pathogenicity of these three groups of
		  viruses. We observed that irrespective of their HA and NA
		  lineages, the TRS viruses were moderately pathogenic in
		  ferrets and grew efficiently in both the upper and lower
		  respiratory tracts. All North American TRS viruses studied
		  were transmitted between ferrets via direct contact.
		  However, their transmissibility by respiratory droplets was
		  related to their HA and NA lineages: TRS viruses with
		  human-like HA and NA were transmitted most efficiently,
		  those with swine-like HA and NA were transmitted minimally
		  or not transmitted, and those with swine-like HA and
		  human-like NA (N2) showed intermediate transmissibility. We
		  conclude that the lineages of HA and NA may play a crucial
		  role in the respiratory droplet transmissibility of these
		  viruses. These findings have important implications for
		  pandemic planning and warrant confirmation.},

		  viruses originated from an avian H1N1 virus. To
		  characterize potential changes in the membrane fusion
		  activity of the hemagglutinin (HA) during avian-to-swine
		  adaptation of the virus, we studied EAsw viruses isolated
		  in the first years of their circulation in pigs and closely
		  related contemporary H1N1 viruses of wild aquatic birds.
		  Compared to the avian viruses, the swine viruses were less
		  sensitive to neutralization by lysosomotropic agent NH 4 Cl
		  in MDCK cells, had a higher pH optimum of hemolytic
		  activity, and were less stable at acidic pH. Eight amino
		  acid substitutions in the HA were found to separate the
		  EAsw viruses from their putative avian precursor; four
		  substitutions—T49 2 S, N72 2 D, R75 2 K, and S113 2
		  F—were located in the structural regions of the HA2
		  subunit known to play a role in acid-induced conformational
		  transition of the HA. We also studied low-pH-induced
		  syncytium formation by cell-expressed HA proteins and found
		  that the HAs of the 1918, 1957, 1968, and 2009 pandemic
		  viruses required a lower pH for fusion induction than did
		  the HA of a represen-tative EAsw virus. Our data show that
		  transmission of an avian H1N1 virus to pigs was accompanied
		  by changes in conforma-tional stability and fusion
		  promotion activity of the HA. We conclude that distinctive
		  host-determined fusion characteristics of the HA may
		  represent a barrier for avian-to-swine and swine-to-human
		  transmission of influenza viruses. IMPORTANCE},

  abstract	= {Complex nonlinear dynamics arise in many fields of science
		  and engineering, but uncovering the underlying differential
		  equations directly from observations poses a challenging
		  task. The ability to symbolically model complex networked
		  systems is key to understanding them, an open problem in
		  many disciplines. Here we introduce for the first time a
		  method that can automatically generate symbolic equations
		  for a nonlinear coupled dynamical system directly from time
		  series data. This method is applicable to any system that
		  can be described using sets of ordinary nonlinear
		  differential equations, and assumes that the (possibly
		  noisy) time series of all variables are observable.
		  Previous automated symbolic modeling approaches of coupled
		  physical systems produced linear models or required a
		  nonlinear model to be provided manually. The advance
		  presented here is made possible by allowing the method to
		  model each (possibly coupled) variable separately,
		  intelligently perturbing and destabilizing the system to
		  extract its less observable characteristics, and
		  automatically simplifying the equations during modeling. We
		  demonstrate this method on four simulated and two real
		  systems spanning mechanics, ecology, and systems biology.
		  Unlike numerical models, symbolic models have explanatory
		  value, suggesting that automated “reverse engineering”
		  approaches for model-free symbolic nonlinear system
		  identification may play an increasing role in our ability
		  to understand progressively more complex systems in the
		  future.},

  abstract	= {Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), particularly
		  zoonoses, represent a significant threat to global health.
		  Emergence is often driven by anthropogenic activity (e.g.,
		  travel, land use change). Although disease emergence
		  frameworks suggest multiple steps from initial zoonotic
		  transmission to human-to-human spread, there have been few
		  attempts to empirically model specific steps. We create a
		  process-based framework to separate out components of
		  individual emergence steps. We focus on early emergence and
		  expand the first step, zoonotic transmission, into
		  processes of generation of pathogen richness, transmission
		  opportunity, and establishment, each with its own
		  hypothesized drivers. Using this structure, we build a
		  spatial empirical model of these drivers, taking bat
		  viruses shared with humans as a case study. We show that
		  drivers of both viral richness (host diversity and climatic
		  variability) and transmission opportunity (human population
		  density, bushmeat hunting, and livestock production) are
		  associated with virus sharing between humans and bats. We
		  also show spatial heterogeneity between the global patterns
		  of these two processes, suggesting that high-priority
		  locations for pathogen discovery and surveillance in
		  wildlife may not necessarily coincide with those for public
		  health intervention. Finally, we offer direction for future
		  studies of zoonotic EIDs by highlighting the importance of
		  the processes underlying their emergence.},

		  hemagglutinin of influenza virus A/PR/8/34, which indicates
		  the presence of five immunodominant antigenic regions
		  exhibiting various degrees of operational linkage. These
		  sites have been located by the identification of changed
		  amino acid residues in mutant viruses that are
		  antigenically altered at each site. Comparison of the
		  antigenic features with the three-dimensional structure of
		  the H3 subtype hemagglutinin shows that the antigenic sites
		  correspond to four topographically distinct regions of the
		  surface of the protein. One of the sites is formed when two
		  regions that are widely separated in the hemagglutinin
		  monomer associate in the assembled trimer. The location of
		  the sites relative to those proposed for the H3 subtype
		  hemagglutinin suggests that carbohydrate modulates the
		  antigenicity of specific regions of the hemagglutinin.

		  stars, underlying almost all automated discovery tasks is
		  the ability to compare and contrast data streams with each

		  the prevalence of data, however, automated methods are not
		  keeping pace. A key bottleneck is that most data comparison
		  algorithms today rely on a human expert to specify what
		  {\textquoteleft}features{\textquoteright} of the data are
		  relevant for comparison. Here, we propose a new principle
		  for estimating the similarity between the sources of
		  arbitrary data streams, using neither domain knowledge nor
		  learning. We demonstrate the application of this principle
		  to the analysis of data from a number of real-world
		  challenging problems, including the disambiguation of
		  electro-encephalograph patterns pertaining to epileptic
		  seizures, detection of anomalous cardiac activity from
		  heart sound recordings and classification of astronomical
		  objects from raw photometry. In all these cases and without
		  access to any domain knowledge, we demonstrate performance
		  on a par with the accuracy achieved by specialized
		  algorithms and heuristics devised by domain experts. We
		  suggest that data smashing principles may open the door to
		  understanding increasingly complex observations, especially
		  when experts do not know what to look for.},

		  corruption, and might be identifiable under severe
		  obfuscation. Our approach is based on uncovering a valid
		  complete inner product on the space of ergodic stationary
		  finite valued processes, providing the latter with the
		  structure of a Hilbert space on the real field. This
		  rigorous construction, based on non-standard
		  generalizations of the notions of sum and scalar
		  multiplication of finite dimensional probability vectors,
		  allows us to meaningfully talk about "angles" between data
		  streams and data sources, and, make precise the notion of
		  orthogonal stochastic processes. In particular, the
		  relative angles appear to be preserved, and identifiable,
		  under severe noise, and will be developed in future as the
		  underlying principle for robust classification, clustering
		  and unsupervised featurization algorithms.},

  abstract	= "Defining structure and detecting the emergence of
		  complexity in nature are inherently subjective, though
		  essential, scientific activities. Despite the difficulties,
		  these problems can be analyzed in terms of how
		  model-building observers infer from measurements the
		  computational capabilities embedded in nonlinear processes.
		  An observer's notion of what is ordered, what is random,
		  and what is complex in its environment depends directly on
		  its computational resources: the amount of raw measurement
		  data, of memory, and of time available for estimation and
		  inference. The discovery of structure in an environment
		  depends more critically and subtlely though on how those
		  resources are organized. The descriptive power of the
		  observer's chosen (or implicit) computational model class,
		  for example, can be an overwhelming determinant in finding
		  regularity in data. This paper presents an overview of an
		  inductive framework-hierarchical ϵ-machine
		  reconstruction—in which the emergence of complexity is
		  associated with the innovation of new computational model
		  classes. Complexity metrics for detecting structure and
		  quantifying emergence, along with an analysis of the
		  constraints on the dynamics of innovation, are outlined.
		  Illustrative examples are drawn from the onset of
		  unpredictability in nonlinear systems, finitary
		  nondeterministic processes, and cellular automata pattern
		  recognition. They demonstrate how finite inference
		  resources drive the innovation of new structures and so
		  lead to the emergence of complexity."

		  probabilistic context-free grammars on the basis of
		  distributions defined over an infinite set of trees or an
		  infinite set of sentences by minimizing the cross-entropy.
		  This problem has applications in cases of context-free
		  approximation of distributions generated by more expressive
		  statistical models. We show several interesting theoretical
		  properties of probabilistic context-free grammars that are
		  estimated in this way, including the previously unknown
		  equivalence between the grammar cross-entropy with the
		  input distribution and the so-called derivational entropy
		  of the grammar itself. We discuss important consequences of
		  these results involving the standard application of the
		  maximum-likelihood estimator on finite tree and sentence
		  samples, as well as other finite-state models such as
		  hidden Markov models and probabilistic finite automata.},

		  animal pathogens have already infected humans. Are there
		  ways to identify high-risk viruses before they emerge in
		  humans? If so, then how and where can identifications be
		  made and by what methods? These were the fundamental
		  questions driving a workshop to examine the future of
		  predictive surveillance for viruses that might jump from
		  animals to infect humans. Virologists, ecologists and
		  computational biologists from academia, federal government
		  and non-governmental organizations discussed opportunities
		  as well as obstacles to the prediction of species jumps
		  using genetic and ecological data from viruses and their
		  hosts, vectors and reservoirs. This workshop marked an
		  important first step towards envisioning both scientific
		  and organizational frameworks for this future capability.
		  Canine parvoviruses as well as seasonal H3N2 and pandemic
		  H1N1 influenza viruses are discussed as exemplars that
		  suggest what to look for in anticipating species jumps. To
		  answer the question of where to look, prospects for
		  discovering emerging viruses among wildlife, bats, rodents,
		  arthropod vectors and occupationally exposed humans are
		  discussed. Finally, opportunities and obstacles are
		  identified and accompanied by suggestions for how to look
		  for species jumps. Taken together, these findings
		  constitute the beginnings of a conceptual framework for
		  achieving a virus surveillance capability that could
		  predict future species jumps.},

		  zoonotic and pandemic influenzas is hampered by complex
		  interactions between viruses, animal hosts and humans. This
		  complexity makes identifying influenza viruses of high
		  zoonotic or pandemic risk, before they emerge from animal
		  populations, extremely difficult and uncertain. As a first
		  step towards assessing zoonotic risk of influenza, we
		  demonstrate a risk assessment framework to assess the
		  relative likelihood of influenza A viruses, circulating in
		  animal populations, making the species jump into humans.
		  The intention is that such a risk assessment framework
		  could assist decision-makers to compare multiple influenza
		  viruses for zoonotic potential and hence to develop
		  appropriate strain-specific control measures. It also
		  provides a first step towards showing proof of principle
		  for an eventual pandemic risk model. We show that the
		  spatial and temporal epidemiology is as important in
		  assessing the risk of an influenza A species jump as
		  understanding the innate molecular capability of the virus.
		  We also demonstrate data deficiencies that need to be
		  addressed in order to consistently combine both
		  epidemiological and molecular virology data into a risk
		  assessment framework.},

		  been known for a long time: overfitting and a selection
		  bias towards covariates with many possible splits or
		  missing values. While pruning procedures are able to solve
		  the overfitting problem, the variable selection bias still
		  seriously affects the interpretability of tree-structured

		  in fusion of viral membrane to the host nuclear membrane
		  during viral replication. Given the abundance of HA on the
		  viral surface, this protein is also the primary target for

		  addition of glycosylation sites on HA are a part of viral
		  evolution to evade the host immune responses, there are
		  specific glycosylation sites that are conserved during most
		  of the evolution of the virus. In the present study, it was
		  demonstrated that one such conserved glycosylation site at

		  receptor-binding specificity and hence would potentially
		  impinge on the host adaptation of the virus.},

  abstract	= {In recent years, various studies have been conducted on
		  the prediction of crime occurrences. This predictive
		  capability is intended to assist in crime prevention by
		  facilitating effective implementation of police patrols.
		  Previous studies have used data from multiple domains such
		  as demographics, economics, and education. Their prediction
		  models treat data from different domains equally. These
		  methods have problems in crime occurrence prediction, such
		  as difficulty in discovering highly nonlinear
		  relationships, redundancies, and dependencies between
		  multiple datasets. In order to enhance crime prediction
		  models, we consider environmental context information, such
		  as broken windows theory and crime prevention through
		  environmental design. In this paper, we propose a
		  feature-level data fusion method with environmental context
		  based on a deep neural network (DNN). Our dataset consists
		  of data collected from various online databases of crime
		  statistics, demographic and meteorological data, and images
		  in Chicago, Illinois. Prior to generating training data, we
		  select crime-related data by conducting statistical
		  analyses. Finally, we train our DNN, which consists of the
		  following four kinds of layers: spatial, temporal,

		  which is recounted in [E. L. Lehmann, Statist. Sci. 12
		  (1997), no. 1, 48--52; MR1466430], but shall use this
		  Preface to indicate the principal changes from the second
		  edition [E. L. Lehmann, Testing statistical hypotheses,
		  Second edition, Wiley, New York, 1986; MR0852406
		  (87j:62001)]. ``The present volume is divided into two
		  parts. Part I (Chapters 1--10) treats small-sample theory,
		  while Part II (Chapters 11--15) treats large-sample theory.
		  The preface to the second edition stated that `the most
		  important omission is an adequate treatment of optimality
		  paralleling that given for estimation in the companion
		  volume [E. L. Lehmann and G. Casella, Theory of point
		  estimation, Second edition, Springer, New York, 1998;
		  MR1639875 (99g:62025)]'. We here remedy this failure by
		  treating the difficult topic of asymptotic optimality (in
		  Chapter 13) together with the large-sample tools needed for
		  this purpose (in Chapters 11 and 12). Having developed
		  these tools, we use them in Chapter 14 to give a much
		  fuller treatment of tests of goodness of fit than was
		  possible in the second edition, and in Chapter 15 to
		  provide an introduction to the bootstrap and related
		  techniques. Various large-sample considerations that in the
		  second edition were discussed in earlier chapters now have
		  been moved to Chapter 11.
		  
		  ``Another major addition is a more comprehensive treatment
		  of multiple testing including some recent optimality
		  results. This topic is now presented in Chapter 9. In order
		  to make room for these extensive additions, we had to
		  eliminate some material found in the second edition,
		  primarily the coverage of the multivariate linear
		  hypothesis.
		  
		  ``Except for some of the basic results from Part I, a
		  detailed knowledge of small-sample theory is not required
		  for Part II. In particular, the necessary background should
		  include: Chapter 3, Sections 3.1--3.5, 3.8--3.9; Chapter 4:
		  Sections 4.1--4.4; Chapter 5, Sections 5.1--5.3; Chapter 6,
		  Sections 6.1--6.2; Chapter 7, Sections 7.1--7.2; Chapter 8,

  abstract	= {The hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay is the primary
		  measurement used for identifying antigenically novel
		  influenza virus strains. HAI assays measure the amount of
		  reference sera required to prevent virus binding to red
		  blood cells. Receptor binding avidities of viral strains
		  are not usually taken into account when interpreting these
		  assays. Here, we created antigenic maps of human H3N2
		  viruses that computationally account for variation in viral
		  receptor binding avidities. These new antigenic maps differ
		  qualitatively from conventional antigenic maps based on HAI
		  measurements alone. We experimentally focused on an
		  antigenic cluster associated with a single N145K
		  hemagglutinin (HA) substitution that occurred between 1992
		  and 1995. Reverse-genetics experiments demonstrated that
		  the N145K HA mutation increases viral receptor binding
		  avidity. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA)
		  revealed that the N145K HA mutation does not prevent
		  antibody binding; rather, viruses possessing this mutation
		  escape antisera in HAI assays simply by attaching to cells
		  more efficiently. Unexpectedly, we found an asymmetric
		  antigenic effect of the N145K HA mutation. Once H3N2
		  viruses acquired K145, an epitope involving amino acid 145
		  became antigenically dominant. Antisera raised against an
		  H3N2 strain possessing K145 had reduced reactivity to H3N2
		  strains possessing N145. Thus, individual mutations in HA
		  can influence antigenic groupings of strains by altering
		  receptor binding avidity and by changing the dominance of
		  antibody responses. Our results indicate that it will be
		  important to account for variation in viral receptor
		  binding avidity when performing antigenic analyses in order
		  to identify genuine antigenic differences among influenza
		  virus variants.},

  abstract	= {As we begin to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, a key
		  question is if we can avert such disasters in future.
		  Current surveillance protocols generally focus on
		  qualitative impact assessments of viral diversity 1. These
		  efforts are primarliy aimed at ecosystem and human impact
		  monitoring, and do not help to precisely quantify
		  emergence. Currently, the similarity of biological strains
		  is measured by the edit distance or the number of mutations
		  that separate their genomic sequences 2{\textendash}6, e.g.
		  the number of mutations that make an avian flu strain
		  human-adapted. However, ignoring the odds of those
		  mutations in the wild keeps us blind to the true jump risk,
		  and gives us little indication of which strains are more
		  risky. In this study, we develop a more meaningful metric
		  for comparison of genomic sequences. Our metric, the
		  q-distance, precisely quantifies the probability of
		  spontaneous jump by random chance. Learning from patterns
		  of mutations from large sequence databases, the q-distance
		  adapts to the specific organism, the background population,
		  and realistic selection pressures; demonstrably improving
		  inference of ancestral relationships and future
		  trajectories. As important application, we show that the
		  q-distance predicts future strains for seasonal Influenza,
		  outperforming World Health Organization (WHO) recommended
		  flu-shot composition almost consistently over two decades.
		  Such performance is demonstrated separately for Northern
		  and Southern hemisphere for different subtypes, and key
		  capsidic proteins. Additionally, we investigate the
		  SARS-CoV-2 origin problem, and precisely quantify the
		  likelihood of different animal species that hosted an
		  immediate progenitor, producing a list of related species
		  of bats that have a quantifiably high likelihood of being
		  the source. Additionally, we identify specific rodents with
		  a credible likelihood of hosting a SARS-CoV-2 ancestor.
		  Combining machine learning and large deviation theory, the
		  analysis reported here may open the door to actionable
		  predictions of future pandemics.Competing Interest

		  We compare its performance with the evidence driven state

		  induction problems of varying target size and training set
		  density. We also study the effects of noisy training data
		  on the evolutionary approach and on EDSM. On noise-free
		  data, we find that our evolutionary method outperforms EDSM
		  on small sparse data sets. In the case of noisy training
		  data, we find that our evolutionary method consistently
		  outperforms EDSM, as well as other significant methods

  abstract	= {Influenza A virus strains adopt different host
		  specificities mainly depending on their hemagglutinin (HA)
		  protein. Via HA, the virus binds sialic acid receptors of
		  the host cell and, upon endocytic uptake, HA triggers
		  fusion between the viral envelope bilayer and the endosomal
		  membrane by a low pH-induced conformational change leading
		  to the release of the viral genome into the host cell
		  cytoplasm. Both functions are crucial for viral infection
		  enabling the genesis of new progeny virus. Adaptation to
		  different hosts in vitro was shown to require mutations
		  within HA altering the receptor binding and/or fusion
		  behavior of the respective virus strain. Human adapted
		  influenza virus strains (H1N1, H3N2, H2N2) as well as
		  recent avian influenza virus strains (H5, H7 and H9
		  subtypes) which gained the ability to infect humans mostly
		  contained mutations in the receptor binding site (RBS) of
		  HA enabling increased binding affinity of these viruses to
		  human type ($\alpha$-2,6 linked sialic acid) receptors.
		  Thus, the receptor binding specificity seems to be the
		  major requirement for successful adaptation to the human
		  host; however, the RBS is not the only determinant of host
		  specificity. Increased binding to a certain cell type does
		  not always correlate with infection efficiency.
		  Furthermore, viruses carrying mutations in the RBS often
		  resulted in reduced viral fitness and were still unable to
		  transmit between mammals. Recently, the pH stability of HA
		  was reported to affect the transmissibility of influenza

		  grammars, methods for assigning probability measures to
		  rewrite rules of probabilistic grammars, and statistical
		  measures for determining how well an inferred probabilistic
		  grammar approximates a sample set. The second concern of
		  the study is the development and implementation of an
		  algorithm for the inference of finite-state probabilistic
		  grammars. This finite-state inference procedure produces a
		  deterministic finite-state probabilistic grammar whose
		  language approximates the sample set within a user-supplied
		  acceptance region under the chi-square test. This procedure
		  is enumerative. Heuristic tree-searching techniques are
		  used to improve efficiency. The convergence of the
		  procedure to an acceptable grammar is demonstrated and the
		  steps of the procedure are theoretically justified. Test
		  results of a PL/I implementation are presented. The
		  inference procedure developed provides a means of
		  synthesizing a probabilistic model of both physical and
		  abstract systems from samples of their behavior.},

  abstract	= {Influenza viruses routinely acquire mutations in antigenic
		  sites on the globular head of the hemagglutinin (HA)
		  protein. Since these antigenic sites are near the receptor
		  binding pocket of HA, many antigenic mutations
		  simultaneously alter the receptor binding properties of HA.
		  We previously reported that a K165E mutation in the Sa
		  antigenic site of A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) HA is associated
		  with secondary neuraminidase (NA) mutations that decrease
		  NA activity. Here, using reverse genetics, we show that the
		  K165E HA mutation dramatically decreases HA binding to
		  sialic acid receptors on cell surfaces. We sequentially
		  passaged reverse-genetics-derived PR8 viruses with the
		  K165E antigenic HA mutation in fertilized chicken eggs, and
		  to our surprise, viruses with secondary NA mutations did
		  not emerge. Instead, viruses with secondary HA mutations
		  emerged in 3 independent passaging experiments, and each of
		  these mutations increased HA binding to sialic acid
		  receptors. Importantly, these compensatory HA mutations
		  were located in the Ca antigenic site and prevented binding
		  of Ca-specific monoclonal antibodies. Taken together, these
		  data indicate that HA antigenic mutations that alter
		  receptor binding avidity can be compensated for by
		  secondary HA or NA mutations. Antigenic diversification of
		  influenza viruses can therefore occur irrespective of
		  direct antibody pressure, since compensatory HA mutations
		  can be located in distinct antibody binding sites.},

@Article{	  olival2017,
  abstract	= {The majority of human emerging infectious diseases are
		  zoonotic, with viruses that originate in wild mammals of
		  particular concern (for example, HIV, Ebola and SARS).
		  Understanding patterns of viral diversity in wildlife and
		  determinants of successful cross-species transmission, or
		  spillover, are therefore key goals for pandemic
		  surveillance programs. However, few analytical tools exist
		  to identify which host species are likely to harbour the
		  next human virus, or which viruses can cross species
		  boundaries. Here we conduct a comprehensive analysis of
		  mammalian host–virus relationships and show that both the
		  total number of viruses that infect a given species and the
		  proportion likely to be zoonotic are predictable. After
		  controlling for research effort, the proportion of zoonotic
		  viruses per species is predicted by phylogenetic
		  relatedness to humans, host taxonomy and human population
		  within a species range—which may reflect human–wildlife
		  contact. We demonstrate that bats harbour a significantly
		  higher proportion of zoonotic viruses than all other
		  mammalian orders. We also identify the taxa and geographic
		  regions with the largest estimated number of 'missing
		  viruses' and 'missing zoonoses' and therefore of highest
		  value for future surveillance. We then show that
		  phylogenetic host breadth and other viral traits are
		  significant predictors of zoonotic potential, providing a
		  novel framework to assess if a newly discovered mammalian
		  virus could infect people.},

@Article{	  pearce2000,
  abstract	= {When I first started studying epidemiology, ecological
		  studies were briefly discussed as an inexpensive but
		  unreliable method for studying individual level risk
		  factors for disease. For example, rather than go to the
		  time and expense to establish a cohort study or
		  case-control study of fat intake and breast cancer, you
		  could simply use national dietary and cancer incidence data
		  and, with minimal time and expense, show a strong
		  correlation internationally between fat intake and breast
		  cancer. This approach was quite rightly regarded as
		  inadequate and unreliable because of the many additional
		  forms of bias that can occur in such studies compared with
		  studies of individuals within a population. In particular,
		  the “ecological fallacy” can occur in that factors that
		  are associated with national disease rates may not be
		  associated with disease in individuals.1 For example,
		  almost any disease that is associated with affluence and
		  Westernisation has in the past been associated at the
		  national level with sales of television sets, and nowadays
		  is probably associated at the national level with rates of
		  internet use.
		  
		  Thus, ecological studies were not a good thing to do, and
		  were a relic of the “pre-modern” phase of epidemiology
		  before it became firmly established with a methodologic
		  paradigm based on the theory of randomised controlled
		  trials of individuals. This paradigm, which is very
		  powerful when used appropriately, gave rise to increasingly
		  sophisticated methods of study design and data analysis. In
		  particular, biostatistical methods that were developed for
		  randomised trials involving a single individual level
		  exposure were used to reformulate and make more rigorous
		  the previously ad hoc epidemiological methods of study
		  design and data analysis.2 3 Thus, epidemiology courses
		  have increasingly become restricted to discussing cohort
		  and case-control studies and the methods of data analysis
		  that fit the clinical trial paradigm on which {\ldots}},

		  objective of this study was to determine the extent to
		  which the increased prevalence of autism in California has
		  been driven by changes in diagnostic practices, diagnostic
		  substitution and diagnostic accretion.\\ Retrospective case
		  record examination of 7003 patients born before 1987 with
		  autism who were enrolled with the California Department of
		  Developmental Services between 1992 and 2005 was carried
		  out. Of principal interest were 631 patients with a sole
		  diagnosis of mental retardation (MR) who subsequently
		  acquired a diagnosis of autism. The outcome of interest was
		  the probability of acquiring a diagnosis of autism as a
		  result of changes in diagnostic practices was calculated.
		  The probability of diagnostic change is then used to model
		  the proportion of the autism caseload arising from changing
		  diagnostic practices.\\ The odds of a patient acquiring an
		  autism diagnosis were elevated in periods in which the
		  practices for diagnosing autism changed. The odds of change
		  in years in which diagnostic practices changed were 1.68
		  [95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.11-2.54], 1.55 (95\% CI
		  1.03-2.34), 1.58 (95\% CI 1.05-2.39), 1.82 (95\% CI
		  1.23-2.7) and 1.61 (95\% CI 1.09-2.39). Using the
		  probability of change between 1992 and 2005 to generalize
		  to the population with autism, it is estimated that 26.4\%
		  (95\% CI 16.25-36.48) of the increased autism caseload in
		  California is uniquely associated with diagnostic change
		  through a single pathway--individuals previously diagnosed
		  with MR.\\ Changes in practices for diagnosing autism have
		  had a substantial effect on autism caseloads, accounting
		  for one-quarter of the observed increase in prevalence in
		  California between 1992 and 2005.}

  abstract	= {Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of
		  neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by social and
		  language deficits, stereotypic behavior, and abnormalities
		  in motor functions. The particular set of behavioral
		  impairments expressed in any given individual is variable
		  across the spectrum. These behavioral abnormalities are
		  consistent with our current understanding of the
		  neuropathology of ASD which suggests abnormalities in the
		  amygdala, temporal and frontal cortexes, hippocampus, and
		  cerebellum. However, regions unrelated to these behavioral
		  deficits appear largely intact. Both genetic predisposition
		  and environmental toxins and toxicants have been implicated
		  in the etiology of autism; the impact of these
		  environmental triggers is associated with increases in
		  oxidative stress, and is further exacerbated when combined
		  with genetic susceptibility. We have previously reported
		  increased levels of 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), a marker of
		  oxidative stress, in ASD cerebella. We have also shown that
		  this increase was associated with an elevation in
		  neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) levels. The objectives of the current
		  study were to determine whether the increase in oxidative
		  stress in ASD is brain region-specific, to identify the
		  specific brain regions affected by oxidative stress, and to
		  compare brain region-specific NT-3 expression between ASD
		  and control cases. The levels of 3-NT and NT-3 were
		  measured with specific ELISAs in individual brain regions
		  of two autistic and age- and postmortem interval
		  (PMI)--matched control donors. In the control brain, the
		  levels of 3-NT were uniformly low in all brain regions
		  examined ranging from 1.6 to 12.0 pmol/g. On the other
		  hand, there was a great variation in 3-NT levels between
		  individual brain regions of the autistic brains ranging
		  from 1.7 to 281.2 pmol/g. The particular brain regions with
		  the increased 3-NT and the magnitude of the increase were
		  both different in the two autistic cases. In the older
		  autistic case, the brain regions with highest levels of
		  3-NT included the orbitofrontal cortex (214.5 pmol/g),
		  Wernicke's area (171.7 pmol/g), cerebellar vermis (81.2
		  pmol/g), cerebellar hemisphere (37.2 pmol/g), and pons
		  (13.6 pmol/g); these brain areas are associated with the
		  speech processing, sensory and motor coordination,
		  emotional and social behavior, and memory. Brain regions
		  that showed 3-NT increase in both autistic cases included
		  the cerebellar hemispheres and putamen. Consistent with our
		  earlier report, we found an increase in NT-3 levels in the
		  cerebellar hemisphere in both autistic cases. We also
		  detected an increase in NT-3 level in the dorsolateral
		  prefrontal cortex (BA46) in the older autistic case and in
		  the Wernicke's area and cingulate gyrus in the younger
		  case. These preliminary results reveal, for the first time,
		  brain region-specific changes in oxidative stress marker
		  3-NT and neurotrophin-3 levels in ASD.}

		  disorders which are currently diagnosed solely on the basis
		  of abnormal stereotyped behavior as well as observable
		  deficits in communication and social functioning. Although
		  a variety of candidate genes have been identified on the
		  basis of genetic analyses and up to 20\% of ASD cases can
		  be collectively associated with a genetic abnormality, no
		  single gene or genetic variant is applicable to more than
		  1-2 percent of the general ASD population. In this report,
		  we apply class prediction algorithms to gene expression
		  profiles of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) from several
		  phenotypic subgroups of idiopathic autism defined by
		  cluster analyses of behavioral severity scores on the
		  Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised diagnostic instrument
		  for ASD. We further demonstrate that individuals from these
		  ASD subgroups can be distinguished from nonautistic
		  controls on the basis of limited sets of differentially
		  expressed genes with a predicted classification accuracy of
		  up to 94\% and sensitivities and specificities of ~90\% or
		  better, based on support vector machine analyses with
		  leave-one-out validation. Validation of a subset of the
		  "classifier" genes by high-throughput quantitative nuclease
		  protection assays with a new set of LCL samples derived
		  from individuals in one of the phenotypic subgroups and
		  from a new set of controls resulted in an overall class
		  prediction accuracy of ~82\%, with ~90\% sensitivity and
		  75\% specificity. Although additional validation with a
		  larger cohort is needed, and effective clinical translation
		  must include confirmation of the differentially expressed
		  genes in primary cells from cases earlier in development,
		  we suggest that such panels of genes, based on expression
		  analyses of phenotypically more homogeneous subgroups of
		  individuals with ASD, may be useful biomarkers for
		  diagnosis of subtypes of idiopathic autism.}

		  cortex and cerebellum tissues from ASD, schizophrenia
		  (SCZ), and healthy subjects (HC) and duodenal biopsies from

		  Differences between SCZ and ASD were observed for most of

		  expression of barrier-forming TJ components (CLDN-1, OCLN,
		  TRIC), whereas 66\% had increased pore-forming CLDNs
		  (CLDN-2, -10, -15) compared to controls.\\ In the ASD
		  brain, there is an altered expression of genes associated

  abstract	= {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD).\\ 2014.\\ The Autism and
		  Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network is an
		  active surveillance system that provides estimates of the
		  prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) among children
		  aged 8 years whose parents or guardians reside within 11
		  ADDM sites in the United States (Arizona, Arkansas,
		  Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, New
		  Jersey, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Wisconsin). ADDM
		  surveillance is conducted in two phases. The first phase
		  involves review and abstraction of comprehensive
		  evaluations that were completed by professional service
		  providers in the community. Staff completing record review
		  and abstraction receive extensive training and supervision
		  and are evaluated according to strict reliability standards
		  to certify effective initial training, identify ongoing
		  training needs, and ensure adherence to the prescribed
		  methodology. Record review and abstraction occurs in a
		  variety of data sources ranging from general pediatric
		  health clinics to specialized programs serving children
		  with developmental disabilities. In addition, most of the
		  ADDM sites also review records for children who have
		  received special education services in public schools. In
		  the second phase of the study, all abstracted information
		  is reviewed systematically by experienced clinicians to
		  determine ASD case status. A child is considered to meet
		  the surveillance case definition for ASD if he or she
		  displays behaviors, as described on one or more
		  comprehensive evaluations completed by community-based
		  professional providers, consistent with the Diagnostic and
		  Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition,
		  Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) diagnostic criteria for autistic
		  disorder; pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise
		  specified (PDD-NOS, including atypical autism); or Asperger
		  disorder. This report provides updated ASD prevalence
		  estimates for children aged 8 years during the 2014
		  surveillance year, on the basis of DSM-IV-TR criteria, and
		  describes characteristics of the population of children
		  with ASD. In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association
		  published the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
		  Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), which made considerable
		  changes to ASD diagnostic criteria. The change in ASD
		  diagnostic criteria might influence ADDM ASD prevalence
		  estimates; therefore, most (85\%) of the records used to
		  determine prevalence estimates based on DSM-IV-TR criteria
		  underwent additional review under a newly operationalized
		  surveillance case definition for ASD consistent with the
		  DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. Children meeting this new
		  surveillance case definition could qualify on the basis of
		  one or both of the following criteria, as documented in
		  abstracted comprehensive evaluations: 1) behaviors
		  consistent with the DSM-5 diagnostic features; and/or 2) an
		  ASD diagnosis, whether based on DSM-IV-TR or DSM-5
		  diagnostic criteria. Stratified comparisons of the number
		  of children meeting either of these two case definitions
		  also are reported.\\ For 2014, the overall prevalence of
		  ASD among the 11 ADDM sites was 16.8 per 1,000 (one in 59)
		  children aged 8 years. Overall ASD prevalence estimates
		  varied among sites, from 13.1-29.3 per 1,000 children aged
		  8 years. ASD prevalence estimates also varied by sex and
		  race/ethnicity. Males were four times more likely than
		  females to be identified with ASD. Prevalence estimates
		  were higher for non-Hispanic white (henceforth, white)
		  children compared with non-Hispanic black (henceforth,
		  black) children, and both groups were more likely to be
		  identified with ASD compared with Hispanic children. Among
		  the nine sites with sufficient data on intellectual
		  ability, 31\% of children with ASD were classified in the
		  range of intellectual disability (intelligence quotient
		  [IQ] <70), 25\% were in the borderline range (IQ 71-85),
		  and 44\% had IQ scores in the average to above average
		  range (i.e., IQ >85). The distribution of intellectual
		  ability varied by sex and race/ethnicity. Although mention
		  of developmental concerns by age 36 months was documented
		  for 85\% of children with ASD, only 42\% had a
		  comprehensive evaluation on record by age 36 months. The
		  median age of earliest known ASD diagnosis was 52 months
		  and did not differ significantly by sex or race/ethnicity.
		  For the targeted comparison of DSM-IV-TR and DSM-5 results,
		  the number and characteristics of children meeting the
		  newly operationalized DSM-5 case definition for ASD were
		  similar to those meeting the DSM-IV-TR case definition,
		  with DSM-IV-TR case counts exceeding DSM-5 counts by less
		  than 5\% and approximately 86\% overlap between the two
		  case definitions (kappa = 0.85).\\ Findings from the ADDM
		  Network, on the basis of 2014 data reported from 11 sites,
		  provide updated population-based estimates of the
		  prevalence of ASD among children aged 8 years in multiple
		  communities in the United States. The overall ASD
		  prevalence estimate of 16.8 per 1,000 children aged 8 years
		  in 2014 is higher than previously reported estimates from
		  the ADDM Network. Because the ADDM sites do not provide a
		  representative sample of the entire United States, the
		  combined prevalence estimates presented in this report
		  cannot be generalized to all children aged 8 years in the
		  United States. Consistent with reports from previous ADDM
		  surveillance years, findings from 2014 were marked by
		  variation in ASD prevalence when stratified by geographic
		  area, sex, and level of intellectual ability. Differences
		  in prevalence estimates between black and white children
		  have diminished in most sites, but remained notable for
		  Hispanic children. For 2014, results from application of
		  the DSM-IV-TR and DSM-5 case definitions were similar,
		  overall and when stratified by sex, race/ethnicity,
		  DSM-IV-TR diagnostic subtype, or level of intellectual
		  ability.\\ Beginning with surveillance year 2016, the DSM-5
		  case definition will serve as the basis for ADDM estimates
		  of ASD prevalence in future surveillance reports. Although
		  the DSM-IV-TR case definition will eventually be phased
		  out, it will be applied in a limited geographic area to
		  offer additional data for comparison. Future analyses will
		  examine trends in the continued use of DSM-IV-TR diagnoses,
		  such as autistic disorder, PDD-NOS, and Asperger disorder
		  in health and education records, documentation of symptoms
		  consistent with DSM-5 terminology, and how these trends
		  might influence estimates of ASD prevalence over time. The
		  latest findings from the ADDM Network provide evidence that
		  the prevalence of ASD is higher than previously reported
		  estimates and continues to vary among certain racial/ethnic
		  groups and communities. With prevalence of ASD ranging from
		  13.1 to 29.3 per 1,000 children aged 8 years in different
		  communities throughout the United States, the need for
		  behavioral, educational, residential, and occupational
		  services remains high, as does the need for increased
		  research on both genetic and nongenetic risk factors for ASD.}

		  microbiota-gut-vagus-heart-brain (MGVHB) axis and its
		  systemic disruption accompanying altered neurodevelopment.
		  Data derived from clinical and animal studies document
		  increased prevalence of gastrointestinal, cardiovascular,
		  cognitive, and behavioral symptoms in both premature and
		  autistic children and suggest an incomplete maturation of
		  the gut-blood barrier resulting in a "leaky gut,"
		  dysbiosis, abnormalities in vagal regulation of the heart,
		  altered development of specific brain regions, and
		  behavior. Furthermore, this review posits the hypothesis
		  that common genetic variants link the abnormalities in the
		  MGVHB axis in premature and autistic pathologies. This
		  hypothesis is based on the recently identified common
		  genetic variants: early B cell factor 1 (EBF1),
		  selenocysteine tRNA-specific eukaryotic elongation factor
		  (EEFSEC), and angiotensin II receptor type 2 (AGTR2), in
		  the maternal and infant DNA samples, associated with risk
		  of preterm birth and independently implicated in a risk of
		  autism. We predict that the AGTR2 variants involved in the
		  brain maturation and oxytocin-arginine-vasopressin
		  (OXT-AVP) pathways, related to social behavior, will
		  contribute to our understanding of the link between
		  prematurity and autism paving a way to new therapies.}

		  about the early developing brainstem in ASD is only

		  consistent with brainstem pathology. Therefore, the purpose
		  of this review was to integrate epidemiological,

		  of brainstem contributions to ASD. Because ASD is a
		  neurodevelopmental condition, we examined the available
		  data through a lens of hierarchical brain development. The
		  review of the literature suggests that developmental
		  alterations of the brainstem could have potential cascading
		  effects on cortical and cerebellar formation, ultimately
		  leading to ASD symptoms. This view is supported by human
		  epidemiology findings and data from animal models of ASD,
		  showing that perturbed development of the brainstem
		  substructures, particularly during the peak formation of
		  the brainstem's monoaminergic centers, may relate to ASD or
		  ASD-like behaviors. Furthermore, we review evidence from
		  human histology, psychophysiology, and neuroimaging
		  suggesting that brainstem development and maturation may be
		  atypical in ASD and may be related to key ASD symptoms,
		  such as atypical sensorimotor features and social
		  responsiveness. From this review there emerges the need of
		  future research to validate early detection of the
		  brainstem-based somatosensory and psychophysiological
		  behaviors that emerge in infancy, and to examine the
		  brainstem across the life span, while accounting for age.
		  In all, there is preliminary evidence for brainstem

  abstract	= {To locate antigenic epitopes on the N8 neuraminidase (NA),
		  we generated a panel of 97 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), 66
		  of which inhibited NA activity (NI antibodies). Three
		  groups of NI MAbs were identified from their different
		  reactivities with escape mutants. Group 1 antibodies
		  recognized the peptide loop containing residues 344 to 346,
		  which appears to be an immunodominant region on the rim of
		  the enzyme center of the N8 NA. Group 2 antibodies
		  recognized a novel epitope containing residues 150, 199,
		  367, 399, and 400 (N2 numbering). From the location of
		  these residues on the three-dimensional structure of the N8
		  NA, the epitope appears to be located at the interface of
		  two adjacent monomers in the tetrameric NA, one
		  contributing residues 150 and 199 and the other
		  contributing residues 367 and 399 to 400. The available
		  evidence indicates that the MAbs of this group react with
		  the NA only after it is fully assembled. The third group of
		  antibodies recognized the peptide loops containing residues
		  367 and 399 to 400. All of the amino acid substitutions in
		  N8 escape mutants which affect the NI activity of
		  antibodies were located in the peptide loops known to form
		  epitopes in the N2 and N9 subtypes, indicating that
		  antigenic regions in the NA head inducing NI antibodies
		  appear to be similar among different subtypes of influenza
		  A viruses. The MAbs used in this study will be valuable in
		  studying the role of each N8 NA epitope in host immune
		  defense systems and in the kinetics analysis of the
		  biosynthesis of the enzyme.},

		  11,986 with ASD). Using an enhanced Bayesian framework to
		  integrate de novo and case-control rare variation, we
		  identify 102 risk genes at a false discovery rate <= 0.1.
		  Of these genes, 49 show higher frequencies of disruptive de
		  novo variants in individuals ascertained for severe

		  the risk genes have roles in regulation of gene expression
		  or neuronal communication (i.e., mutations effect
		  neurodevelopmental and neurophysiological changes), and 13
		  fall within loci recurrently hit by copy number variants.
		  In human cortex single-cell gene expression data,
		  expression of risk genes is enriched in both excitatory and
		  inhibitory neuronal lineages, consistent with multiple

		  algorithm discovered Hamiltonians, Lagrangians, and other

  abstract	= {In 2009, we successfully produced a high-yield live
		  attenuated H1N1pdm A/California/7/2009 vaccine (CA/09 LAIV)
		  by substitution of three residues (K119E, A186D, and D222G)
		  in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein. Since then, we have
		  generated and evaluated additional H1N1pdm vaccine
		  candidates from viruses isolated in 2010 and 2011. The 2010
		  strains with the new HA substitutions near the HA receptor
		  binding site (N125D and D127E or D127E and K209E) grew well
		  in eggs and formed large plaques in Madin-Darby canine
		  kidney (MDCK) cells. Introduction of these acidic amino
		  acids into the HA of CA/09 also improved vaccine virus
		  growth in eggs to a titer comparable to that of CA/09 LAIV.
		  However, the high growth of A/Gilroy/231/2011 (Gil/11)
		  vaccine virus required modification in both the HA and the
		  NA segments. The residue at position 369 of the NA was
		  found to be critical for virus replication in MDCK cells
		  and eggs. These HA and NA residues had minimal impact on
		  viral entry but greatly improved viral release from
		  infected cells. Our data implied that the HA receptor
		  binding and NA receptor cleaving function of the
		  poor-growth H1N1pdm virus was not well balanced for virus
		  replication in host cells. The high-growth vaccine
		  candidates described in this study maintained vaccine virus
		  antigenicity and induced high levels of neutralizing
		  antibodies in immunized ferrets, making them suitable for
		  vaccine production. The identification of the amino acids
		  and their roles in viral replication should greatly help
		  vaccine manufacturers to produce high-yield reassortant
		  vaccine viruses against the future drifted H1N1pdm
		  viruses.},

  abstract	= {Influenza A H3N2 virus caused 1968 Hong Kong influenza
		  pandemic, and has since been one of the most prevalent
		  seasonal influenza viruses in global populations,
		  representing a credible pandemic candidate in future.
		  Previous studies have established that the hemagglutinin
		  (HA) protein is the predominant antigen and executes
		  receptor binding and membrane fusion. Homologous sequence
		  analysis of all HA subtypes of influenza viruses revealed
		  that two cysteine residues (540 and 544) are uniquely
		  present in the transmembrane domain (TM) of HA proteins
		  from all influenza A H3N2 viruses. However, the functions
		  of these two cysteines have not been fully studied. Here,
		  we generated three mutants (C540S, C544L, and 2C/SL) to
		  investigate the effects of the two TM cysteines on the
		  biological functions of H3 HA. We herein presented
		  evidences that the mutations of one or two of the cysteines
		  did not affect the proper expressions of HA proteins in
		  cells, and more importantly all mutant H3 HAs showed
		  decreased thermal stability but increased fusion activity
		  in comparison with wildtype HA. Our results taken together
		  demonstrated that the two TM cysteines are important for
		  the biological functions of H3 HA proteins.},

  abstract	= {The virologic factors that limit the transmission of swine
		  influenza viruses between humans are unresolved. While it
		  has been shown that acquisition of the neuraminidase (NA)
		  and matrix (M) gene segments from a Eurasian-lineage swine
		  virus was required for airborne transmission of the 2009
		  pandemic H1N1 virus (H1N1pdm09), we show here that an
		  arginine to lysine change in the hemagglutinin (HA) was
		  also necessary. This change at position 149 was distal to
		  the receptor binding site but affected virus-receptor
		  affinity and HA dynamics, allowing the virus to replicate
		  more efficiently in nasal turbinate epithelium and
		  subsequently transmit between ferrets. Receptor affinity
		  should be considered as a factor limiting swine virus
		  spread in humans.},
