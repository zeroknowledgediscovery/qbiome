@article{pmid25928420,
 abstract = {It is known that postnatal functional maturation of the
small intestine is facilitated by microbial colonization of
the gut. Preterm infants exhibit defects in gut maturation,
weak innate immunity against intestinal infection and
increased susceptibility to inflammatory disorders, all of
which may be related to the inappropriate microbial
colonization of their immature intestines. The earliest
microbes to colonize the preterm infant gut encounter a
naÃƒÂ¯ve, immature intestine. Thus this earliest microbiota
potentially has the greatest opportunity to fundamentally
influence intestinal development and immune function. The
aim of this study was to characterize the effect of early
microbial colonization on global gene expression in the
distal small intestine during postnatal gut development.\\
Gnotobiotic mouse models with experimental colonization by
early (prior to two weeks of life) intestinal microbiota
from preterm human infants were utilized. Microarray
analysis was used to assess global gene expression in the
intestinal epithelium.\\ Multiple intestinal genes involved
in metabolism, cell cycle regulation, cell-cell or
cell-extracellular matrix communication, and immune
function are developmental- and intestinal microbiota-
regulated. Using a humanized gnotobiotic mouse model, we
demonstrate that certain early preterm infant microbiota
from prior to 2 weeks of life specifically induce increased
NF-ÃŽÂºB activation and a phenotype of increased
inflammation whereas other preterm microbiota specifically
induce decreased NF-ÃŽÂºB activation. These fundamental
differences correlate with altered clinical outcomes and
suggest the existence of optimal early microbial
communities to improve health outcomes.},

from those of their term counterparts due to maternal
microbial diversity, delivery mode, feeding methods,
antibiotic use, and exposure to commensal microbiota and
pathogens in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Early
gut microbiome dysbiosis predisposes neonates to
necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a devastating intestinal
disease with high morbidity and mortality. Though
mechanisms of NEC pathogenesis are not fully understood,
the microbiome is a promising therapy target for prevention
and treatment. Direct administration of probiotics to
preterm infants has been shown to reduce the incidence of
NEC, but is not without risk. The immature immune systems
of preterm infants leave them vulnerable to even beneficial
bacteria. Further research is required to investigate both
short-term and long-term effects of probiotic
administration to preterm infants. Other methods of
altering the preterm infant microbiome must also be
considered, including breastfeeding, prebiotics, and
targeting the maternal microbiome.},
